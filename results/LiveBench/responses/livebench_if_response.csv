 Half-submerged by a jungle and populated by cows, chickens and goats, it is one of the more unusual tourist attractions on the South Pacific island of Rarotonga: the “cursed” Sheraton hotel complex, a long-abandoned luxury resort that has lain derelict for a quarter of a century. The crumbling, graffiti-covered buildings are overgrown with creepers. The only human visitors to the 70-acre site in Vaimaanga pay a small fee to explore what has become known as the biggest white elephant in the South Pacific. The Italian-backed hotel project, which began in the late 1980s, was designed to revolutionise tourism in the remote Cook Islands by providing the tiny nation with its first five-star resort. But the house of cards collapsed at the 11th hour, with the project 80% complete, amid allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering back in Italy. The Cook Islands government was left with a debt of $120m and was almost bankrupted. In the years since, repeated attempts to finish the project have foundered, but now a new effort to salvage the buildings is under way, and could have an even bigger impact on the tiny Pacific state than the original plans were expected to. Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander who has been involved in property development in New Zealand, claims to have hundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese backing. He hopes to rebuild the complex and turn the Pacific backwater into a favourite destination for tourists from China. Until now tourism in the Cooks – a nation of 15 islands scattered across an area the size of India – has relied mainly on visitors from Australia and New Zealand, who tend to focus on the capital Rarotonga and the atoll of Aitutaki, a 50-minute flight north.

The abandoned Sheraton hotel complex on Rarotonga in the Cook Islands has become an unusual tourist attraction, with its half-submerged buildings now inhabited by livestock and overtaken by jungle. The luxury resort project, which began in the late 1980s and was 80% complete, collapsed amid allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering in Italy, leaving the Cook Islands government with a $120 million debt that nearly bankrupted the nation.

For 25 years, the crumbling, graffiti-covered 70-acre site in Vaimaanga has stood as what many call ""the biggest white elephant in the South Pacific,"" with visitors paying a small fee to explore the ruins. The Italian-backed project was originally intended to revolutionize tourism in the remote Cook Islands by providing its first five-star resort.

***

After numerous failed attempts to complete the project over the years, a new effort is now underway that could have an even greater impact on the small Pacific nation than originally anticipated. Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander with experience in New Zealand property development, claims to have secured hundreds of millions in Chinese backing to rebuild the complex.

***

Tepaki's ambitious plan aims to transform the Pacific backwater into a popular destination for Chinese tourists.

 Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation. Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer “yes or no” to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”. Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way Donald Trump’s campaign used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year. “I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality. “To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state. They want leaders who will make clear decisions.

 In July this year, everyone said that the World Cup final felt like a turning point. You don’t get 27,000 people to a women’s cricket match and not think that something extraordinary is going on. But the truth of turning points is that you can’t in the moment judge whether they’re real or perceived. It has taken the Women’s Ashes in Australia this past month to show the extent of the turn. Australia originally lagged behind England in embracing the game. The 2015 Ashes was played at intimate cricket grounds, selling out some matches with crowds in excess of 5000. The 2013-14 version in Australia was nowhere near that. Attendances at the Perth Test were in the low hundreds, while the Twenty20s were sparsely attended curtain-raisers for a meaningless men’s series. Olympiads stack up like sedimentary layers, and the difference from four years ago to now is extraordinary. The day-night Test match drew over 12,600 across its duration, while the three T20 matches drew a bit over or a bit under 4000 spectators apiece.

The Guardian article discusses a significant shift in women's cricket following the World Cup final in July, which drew 27,000 spectators. This apparent turning point has been confirmed by the Women's Ashes in Australia, showing remarkable growth compared to previous events. While Australia initially lagged behind England in supporting women's cricket, with the 2013-14 Ashes in Australia drawing only hundreds of spectators, the recent tournament has seen substantial attendance increases. The day-night Test match attracted over 12,600 spectators across its duration, while T20 matches consistently drew around 4,000 fans each, demonstrating extraordinary progress in just four years.

Women's cricket is experiencing unprecedented growth, as evidenced by recent attendance figures. The article traces this development from the World Cup final in July that attracted 27,000 spectators—a potential watershed moment—to the Women's Ashes series in Australia that confirmed this upward trajectory. The contrast between past and present is striking: while Australia's 2013-14 hosting saw Perth Test matches with only hundreds of attendees and poorly-attended T20 games, the recent Ashes series featured a day-night Test drawing over 12,600 fans and T20 matches consistently attracting approximately 4,000 spectators. This remarkable four-year transformation suggests women's cricket is gaining significant mainstream appeal.","1. The article reflects on how significant moments in sports, like the World Cup final, can be seen as turning points even if their impact may not be immediately clear.

2. The piece discusses the idea that while major sporting events, such as the World Cup final, are hailed as turning points, their true impact often only becomes apparent later. It then examines the Women’s Ashes series in Australia, contrasting previous low-attendance matches with the recent surge in spectator numbers, which marks a significant transformation in how women’s cricket is embraced and attended.","In July, the Women's World Cup final seemed like a turning point for women's cricket due to high attendance.

The article discusses the perception of a turning point for women's cricket following the World Cup final.

 Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.

 Confirmation of Robert Mugabe’s ouster prompted revelry on the streets of Harare. “The Goblin has gone!” raved one. Thousands of miles away in Beijing – for years Mugabe’s most powerful backer – there were no obvious signs of jubilation. “China respects Mr Mugabe’s decision to resign,” foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters, praising his “historic contribution” to Zimbabwe’s liberation. “He remains a good friend of the Chinese people.” But experts believe China’s leaders will be both relieved and contented to see the back of “Comrade Bob” – a suspicion reinforced by the approving tone coverage of his demise has taken in the Communist party-controlled press. “We need change in our country,” China’s official news agency Xinhua – whose correspondents’ dispatches are expected, above all else, to reflect the party line – quoted one Zimbabwean teacher as saying of Mugabe’s resignation. “We’re very happy,” another Zimbabwean told party mouthpiece the People’s Daily. “Finally things will change.” Ross Anthony, an expert in China-Africa relations from South Africa’s Stellenbosch University, said that while Beijing had backed Mugabe since his days as a Marxist revolutionary in the 1970s, it had increasingly seen him as erratic, an embarrassment and a threat to Chinese investments. A case in point was Mugabe’s controversial indigenisation law, which required all foreign companies to be controlled by Zimbabweans and was a particular blow to Chinese interests in its diamond industry. “I imagine there are quite a lot of officials in Beijing who will be happy to see Mugabe go,” Anthony said.

While Zimbabwe's streets celebrated Robert Mugabe's resignation with people dancing on roofs and exclaiming ""The Goblin has gone!"", China's reaction was notably muted. As a key figure in Zimbabwe's liberation and a longtime ally, Mugabe remained ""a good friend of the Chinese people"" according to official statements. However, experts believe Chinese officials are privately relieved to see him go. Nobody in Beijing publicly celebrated, but Chinese state media painted an approving picture of the transition, highlighting Zimbabweans' desire for change. Ross Anthony suggests that Chinese leaders had grown concerned about Mugabe's erratic leadership and policies that threatened Chinese investments, particularly the indigenisation law that was a brush with economic disaster for China's interests in Zimbabwe's diamond industry. This law, which required foreign companies to have Zimbabwean majority control, had become problematic for Beijing's economic strategy in the region, affecting investments potentially meant to benefit future generations, including Mugabe's own daughter.","Robert Mugabe’s resignation sparked widespread celebrations in Harare, with locals expressing relief at his departure—his ouster seen by many as a turning point for Zimbabwe. In contrast, Beijing maintained a reserved tone, with officials neither celebrating nor openly condemning his exit. Chinese authorities commended Mugabe’s ""historic contribution"" to Zimbabwe’s liberation, yet experts noted that many in Beijing viewed him as an erratic figure whose policies, such as the controversial indigenisation law, had negatively impacted Chinese investments. It appears that, much like an unexpected brush clearing away the old for the new, change is now on the horizon—even if, as often happens, nobody is overseeing the transition from the proverbial roof, and whispers suggest that even Mugabe’s daughter might view the development as the end of an era.","Following Robert Mugabe's ouster, while Zimbabweans celebrated, China offered a measured response, acknowledging Mugabe's ""historic contribution"" and friendship.

 Robert Mugabe’s removal from power on Tuesday was greeted as his ascension to it 37 years earlier had been: with jubilation. In Harare there was dancing and singing, honks and cheers, and tears of joy. Many of those celebrating have known no other ruler. Once he was a liberation hero to his people. When he lost their support he hung on by every means at his disposal. Now his brutal reign is over. But the hope is shaded this time by deep concern about what lies ahead. Forcing his resignation was hardly simple: it took much manoeuvring, a military intervention and the opening of impeachment proceedings before he had to bow to the inevitable. What comes next is murkier still, though Emmerson Mnangagwa, his recently fired vice-president, is expected to take over. There is not much exultation on that score, except among “the Crocodile’s” relieved allies.

 Considering an increasingly uncomfortable and world-weary Ange Postecoglou has spent the past month throwing esoteric smoke bombs at questions about his future it hardly seems surprising that on Wednesday he announced his resignation as Socceroos coach. A bigger shock would have been to hear that he was staying on. Nevertheless, on the surface, his decision to leave the Socceroos a week after overseeing their qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia doesn’t make a lot of sense. Though it may be disingenuous on his part – given that he would have been heavily involved in all manner of discussions with Postecoglou over the past weeks and, indeed, years – even Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop conceded this morning that he too was “puzzled” by it. For most of us in the cheap seats it does indeed seem odd. You go to the back-breaking trouble of tearing down and then rebuilding a playing style in-line with an aspirational philosophy, you scour the world for overlooked Australian talent, you soak through business shirts from Kazakhstan to Bangkok, and you make yourself the target of the slings and arrows of both outrageous fortune and look-at-me punditry; and you do this all in the hope of steering your team to the World Cup finals, football’s biggest stage. But then just when you’ve done the hardest bit, just when you’ve got them over the line despite all the public challenges and personal sacrifices along the way, you chuck it all in. This isn’t the way these things normally happen. Coaches resign all the time, of course, but usually only when they notice the axe glinting above their heads. One suspects we’ve a lot to learn yet abut the dynamic between Postecoglou and his employers at FFA but there’s no suggestion at this time that Postecoglou’s position was in jeopardy.

In a move that has left football observers making comparisons to other coaching exits, Ange Postecoglou has announced his resignation as Socceroos coach, just one week after securing Australia's entry into the 2018 World Cup in Russia. This decision comes after a month of cryptic responses about his future with the team.

The timing of his choice to leave is particularly baffling. Postecoglou had dedicated himself to rebuilding the team's playing style and philosophy, traveling extensively from Kazakhstan to Bangkok in search of Australian talent, and weathering harsh criticism from pundits. To resign after accomplishing the most challenging goal—World Cup qualification—defies conventional coaching behavior.

Even Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop expressed being ""puzzled"" by the resignation. Unlike typical coaching departures where politics and job security often play a role, there's no indication Postecoglou's position was threatened. This suggests deeper issues between the coach and FFA leadership that haven't yet come to light.

While coaches frequently step down when they sense termination is imminent, Postecoglou's exit appears entirely self-determined. The unexpected nature of his departure raises questions about what occurs behind closed doors in the FFA's executive bedroom of power, and what factors could drive a successful coach to abandon his team just as they prepare for football's grandest stage.","An unusual resignation has left many puzzled. Ange Postecoglou, after guiding the Socceroos to World Cup qualification in Russia, announced his departure despite having secured a significant football entry point for Australia on its biggest stage. His decision, coming on the heels of a month filled with elusive hints about his future, has invited widespread comparison to typical coaching resignations, which usually occur only when dismissal is imminent. Although Postecoglou’s actions might appear like a sudden leave from his position, insiders including Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop admitted they were as confused as the fans.

In the public arena, the announcement has sparked debates that extend far beyond the football pitch—touching on off-field politics reminiscent of personal disputes one might overhear even in a bedroom setting. The manager’s abrupt exit raises questions about underlying dynamics with the FFA and whether internal politics had influenced his decision. Despite the strategic rebuilding of playing style and resourcefully scouting talent from across the globe, just as challenges were conquered and dreams on the horizon, Postecoglou decided to step away, leaving many to wonder what truly motivated this move.","Ange Postecoglou's resignation as Socceroos coach, just a week after leading them to World Cup qualification, has raised eyebrows. After much speculation and dodging questions, his departure isn't entirely shocking, but the timing is puzzling. Even Football Federation Australia (FFA) CEO David Gallop expressed his bewilderment, despite likely having been heavily involved in discussions with Postecoglou.

The article highlights the oddity of leaving after enduring the arduous journey of rebuilding the team, scouting talent, and facing public scrutiny to reach the World Cup. It contrasts this situation with the typical scenario where coaches resign when facing imminent dismissal, yet there is no **comparison** to be made as Postecoglou's job was not at risk. There is an unknown dynamic between him and the FFA. Though Postecoglou is now able to return to the **bedroom** and rest, no one would **leave** a plumb assignment at the height of their success.

 Patients are being put at risk because doctors are giving them drugs they do not need and sending them for unnecessary surgery to avoid a complaint being made against them, research has revealed. Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more “defensive medicine” than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. “This involved ‘hedging’, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as ‘avoidance’, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,” according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. “These behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,” they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the “burden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,” the study said. “While the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,” it added. Doctors who resort to “fear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care” also waste vital resources and their conduct “creates significant costs for the NHS”, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy’s health budget. The General Medical Council, which regulates Britain’s 250,000 doctors, receives 9,000-10,000 complaints a year.

<<Defensive Medicine: A Perverse Effect on Patient Care>>

SECTION 1
A new study reveals that many doctors in Britain are practicing ""defensive medicine"" due to the stress and fear associated with patient complaints. This involves unnecessary tests, over-referrals, and overprescribing (""hedging""), as well as avoiding high-risk procedures or patients (""avoidance""). The findings indicate that this ""storm"" of defensive practices, though born due to the intention of protecting patients, can actually compromise patient care and waste NHS resources.

***

SECTION 2
The research highlights that a significant proportion of doctors who face complaints adopt these defensive strategies. While the regulatory system aims to safeguard patients from negligence, the associated stress leads to unintended consequences, potentially causing more harm than good overall.

***

SECTION 3
The lead researcher, Prof. Tom Bourne, suggests that the current system may be having a ""perverse effect"" by causing doctors to prioritize defensive practices over optimal patient care. The scale of wasted resources is difficult to quantify, but a study from Italy suggests it could represent a substantial portion of the healthcare budget. Nothing has been mentioned on how the NHS is going to ""tackle"" or go ""green"" with this issue.

Labor and the Greens want more renewables, while the Liberal National party and One Nation are pushing for a new coal-fired power station. The disputes are not over the desirability of public ownership (both sides support it). Nor are they, in any serious sense, about electricity prices (no one can reduce them by much). They aren’t even about jobs, or rather, they are more about what kinds of jobs we want to create than about the number that will be created.

 The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.

 The major and the father seek salvation for the refugees of Manus Island, Papua New Guinea.

Speaking at his Papitalai parish church on Los Negros Island, across a small bay from the detention centre, Taulam said the enforced shutdown of the centre – in which 380 men remain – had left people vulnerable and suffering. Over years of pastoral care, he has built up friendships with many of those in the centre, he told the Guardian and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “Now when they say they have no food, no water, no lights, they are deprived physically but they are saying too, that the physical is also spiritual for them. They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.” Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre. “Australia seems to be saying, ‘Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility’. And Papua New Guinea is saying to Australia, ‘Do your work, clean up your mess.’ And while this is going on, these people are suffering.” “I’ve been talking with them, going to see them.

 Late last year, the Electoral Commission started an investigation into a striking set of circumstances. In February 2016 Steve Baker MP, lobbying for Vote Leave to be designated the “official” leave campaign, sent a round robin email asking recipients to support it, because it claimed to have found a loophole in the spending rules. “It is open to the Vote Leave family to create separate legal entities each of which could spend £700k: Vote Leave will be able to spend as much money as is necessary to win the referendum,” he wrote. But Baker – now a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) – got it wrong. The law that protects our democracy from capture appears to make this behaviour illegal: when a sockpuppet signs your cheques, the spending still counts as yours. The Electoral Commission knew about Baker’s email – it was reported in the Times. But despite knowing that Vote Leave appeared to have contemplated acting unlawfully, the Electoral Commission went ahead and designated it as the official leave campaign. Then we come to the referendum campaign. With under a month to go, Vote Leave was bumping up against the limits of what it could lawfully spend. But it had plenty of money left over from wealthy donors.

 The French Socialist senator Nadine Grelet-Certenais has fired up a heated debate in France over the depiction of smoking in the movies. She wants it stubbed out, for good, on the basis that Gallic heroes puffing away on the silver screen makes the filthy habit seem cool and provides the evil tobacco industry with free advertising. Ban it, and everything will be made miraculously better – c’est simple. Her call has been taken up by the health minister, Agnès Buzyn, and suddenly film-makers have a fight on their hands. The problem with this is that it totally ignores the venerable history of French cinema, which plays out as a long, drawn-out visual love letter to the act of smoking. Smoking a cigarette and cinema have always gone perfectly together – they are both ways of killing time, after all – but the moving image also captures the act of smoking so much better than other art forms, such as still photography. The flare of a match or lighter, and then the upward curl of smoke are forever seductive. All the best French film directors knew this and have exploited it endlessly. Think of virtually any famous French film and cigarettes are an essential ingredient. Jean-Luc Godard’s À Bout de Souffle (Breathless) opens with Jean-Paul Belmondo driving and smoking, a fag dangling from his lower lip, and for the next 90 minutes he chainsmokes his way through the entire story until, shot in the back, he runs away, still puffing, to collapse and die on the street.

 The former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock has been appointed to examine if Australian law adequately protects the human right to religious freedom. Ruddock’s appointment by cabinet, announced on Wednesday, is designed to head off a bruising debate about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the review was “no substitute” for those amendments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was important to look at the issue of religious freedom carefully, in light of the yes vote and impending legislation on marriage equality. While senior conservatives including Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann have publicly suggested a religious freedom bill can be considered next year, separately to a marriage bill, others including Morrison and Liberal senator, David Fawcett, have insisted it be considered at the same time. Ruddock has been asked to report by 31 March. Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. “Any reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “There is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. The government is particularly concerned to prevent uncertainties caused by generally worded bill of rights-style declarations. “This will be a timely expert stocktake to inform consideration of any necessary legislative reforms.” Turnbull said Ruddock was the right person to conduct the review because he had served as Australia’s special envoy for human rights.

 Last weekend Faced with a quiet moment, Donald Trump tends to stir up a spat with a sports star or a celebrity, seemingly in order to open new fronts in America’s “culture wars” and reassure his base about which side he’s on. When it comes to sports, Trump’s targets are often African American, and he pursued a few such targets this week. Regular readers may remember that when last week the president asked China to free three UCLA basketball players accused of shoplifting, his main concern was that the players would thank him, which they did. But when LaVar Ball, the father of one of the arrested players and an inveterate attention seeker himself, questioned just how critical a role Trump actually played, it enraged the president. “I should have left them in jail!” he tweeted on Sunday, adding six hours later that he “should have gotten his son [LiAngelo Ball] out during my next trip to China instead … Very ungrateful!” Trump – whose sons Donald Jr and Eric are well-known hunters – also gave more clues about his perhaps surprisingly critical views on the US Fish and Wildlife Service plan to allow imports of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, tweeting: “Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.” Monday Returning to his racially tinged offensive, Trump singled out Marshawn Lynch of the Oakland Raiders for sitting down during the playing of The Star-Spangled Banner. “Great disrespect!” tweeted the president, adding another dog whistle for the base when he pointed out that Lynch had stood up “for the Mexican anthem”. Black athletes have been protesting during the national anthem since the summer, to highlight police violence and racial injustice. Tuesday Sexual misconduct accusations against the Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore are a less divisive issue, at least outside Alabama – Moore has been condemned widely, including by numerous GOP figures. But after some prevaricating Trump came down on the candidate’s side. Asked the memorable question “Is Roy Moore, [allegedly] a child molester, better than a Democrat?”, Trump pointed out that Moore denied the claims against him, one of which involves a woman who was 14 at the time, and said: “I can tell you one thing for sure: we don’t need a liberal person in there, a Democrat.” Trump has himself been accused by numerous women of sexual harassment.

 Thibaut Courtois does not expect discussions to resume over a new contract at Chelsea until the end of the season, when he will be entering the final 12 months of his deal. The previous round of talks in May failed to reach an agreement. The goalkeeper, who spent three successful years on loan at Atlético Madrid after joining Chelsea from Genk, has been an integral part of the team who have won two Premier League titles in the past three seasons. His agent, Christophe Henrotay, held talks with the champions towards the end of last season, seeking to take the Belgian’s wages closer to the £200,000 a week level enjoyed by Eden Hazard at Stamford Bridge and another of the division’s elite goalkeepers, David de Gea, at Manchester United. Although Courtois – who kept 16 clean sheets in the league last season – is happy at Chelsea and willing to sign improved terms, he has regularly expressed his fondness for life in La Liga, where his situation continues to be monitored by a number of clubs, notably Real Madrid. His former girlfriend has returned to Spain with the couple’s two children. Chelsea are well aware of interest in him from Spanish clubs and will be anxious to achieve a positive resolution before the player goes into the final year of his deal, potentially damaging his value and their bargaining position. “The most important thing is to perform well for myself and the team,” said Courtois before the Champions League game against Qarabag. “Regarding my contract, that’s something where Chelsea must deal with my agent.

The Belgian international, who has been a key player for Chelsea, helping them secure two Premier League titles in the past three seasons, failed to reach an agreement during the previous discussions held in May. Prior to joining Chelsea from Genk, Courtois spent three successful years on loan at Atlético Madrid, building his reputation as one of the top goalkeepers in European football. His agent, Christophe Henrotay, conducted negotiations with Chelsea last season, aiming to increase Courtois' wages to approximately £200,000 per week, comparable to what Eden Hazard earns at Stamford Bridge and what David de Gea receives at Manchester United. Despite being content at Chelsea and willing to sign improved terms, Courtois has frequently expressed his affection for life in Spain, making his situation of interest to several La Liga clubs.

Real Madrid appears to be particularly interested in monitoring Courtois' contract situation at Chelsea. Adding complexity to the situation is the fact that Courtois' former girlfriend has returned to Spain with their two children, which could potentially influence his future career decisions. Chelsea management is well aware of the Spanish clubs' interest in their goalkeeper and will be eager to secure a new deal before Courtois enters the final year of his contract. Allowing the situation to drag on could significantly diminish Courtois' transfer value and weaken Chelsea's negotiating position in the market. The goalkeeper kept an impressive 16 clean sheets in the Premier League last season, demonstrating his continued value to the team. When questioned about his contract situation before a Champions League match against Qarabag, Courtois attempted to shift focus away from the negotiations.

Courtois stated that his primary concern was performing well for himself and the team rather than focusing on contract discussions. He indicated that contract matters should be handled between Chelsea and his agent, suggesting he was maintaining some distance from the negotiation process. According to Courtois, there hadn't been any significant developments in the contract talks at the time of his comments before the Champions League fixture. This stance shows the goalkeeper is attempting to remain professional and focused on his on-field performance while his future at Chelsea remains uncertain. The unresolved contract situation creates potential instability for Chelsea, who risk losing one of their most valuable players either at a reduced fee or on a free transfer if the matter isn't resolved promptly. With his proven track record in both the Premier League and La Liga, Courtois would likely have multiple options should he decide to leave Chelsea when his contract approaches its conclusion. The goalkeeper's situation represents a common challenge for top clubs trying to retain their elite players amid competition from other European giants who can offer comparable financial packages and sporting opportunities.

The latest negotiations are scheduled to resume at the end of the season after previous talks in May stalled without an agreement. His contributions to Chelsea’s title-winning campaigns have made him one of the club’s key players. His impressive performance, including recording 16 clean sheets last season, has significantly bolstered his reputation. The player’s history includes a successful loan spell at Atlético Madrid, further highlighting his elite status. His current contract situation has attracted considerable attention from both his agent and the media. This pressure underscores the importance of solidifying his new deal before it potentially affects his market value.

His agent, Christophe Henrotay, is pushing for an enhanced wage package, aiming for a weekly pay close to £200,000. This figure would place Courtois in the same elite wage bracket as players like Eden Hazard and David de Gea. The demand for improved terms reflects the high value attributed to his on-field performances and overall contribution to the team. Chelsea is acutely aware that prolonged negotiations could undermine their bargaining position. Interest from prominent Spanish clubs, including Real Madrid, adds another layer of complexity to the discussions. Courtois has expressed his satisfaction with life at Chelsea, yet personal inclinations towards La Liga are evident. The balancing act between his commitment to Chelsea and potential moves abroad is a key theme in these negotiations.

Previous talks in May didn't result in an agreement. Courtois, who had a successful loan spell at Atlético Madrid, has been key to Chelsea's two Premier League titles in the last three years. His agent, Christophe Henrotay, wants to increase Courtois's wages to around £200,000 a week. This is the level that Eden Hazard earns at Chelsea and that David de Gea earns at Manchester United.

Courtois is content at Chelsea and willing to extend his contract with improved conditions. However, he often speaks fondly of his time in La Liga, where several clubs, particularly Real Madrid, are watching his situation. His former girlfriend and their two children have moved back to Spain. Chelsea recognizes the interest from Spanish clubs and wants to reach an agreement before Courtois enters the final year of his contract. This would protect his market value and strengthen their negotiating position.

Courtois stated that his focus is on performing well for himself and the team. He also mentioned that Chelsea needs to handle the contract negotiations with his agent. He doesn't believe there have been any new developments regarding his contract. Chelsea are eager to secure Courtois's future given his importance to the team and the risk of losing him to a Spanish club. The situation is further complicated by his personal ties to Spain. Courtois' future at Chelsea remains uncertain.

The opening sentences of this Guardian article present a satirical critique of weekend cookery shows and costume dramas on television. The author employs creative language and imagery to poke fun at these annual television staples. The weekend cookery shows are portrayed as formulaic celebrations of ""banter"" where figures like Tim Lovejoy appear in distressed chambray shirts saying ""yeah"" repeatedly. These shows, such as Saturday Kitchen, Sunday Brunch, and Saturday Morning With James Martin, seem to suck the authenticity out of cooking, reducing it to predictable performances.

The article's description of the food being prepared is deliberately absurd, mentioning ""Scallops in chino runoff"" and ""Steak in Lynx Sport Blast® reduction,"" suggesting these shows value style over substance. There's an implied criticism of the forced camaraderie between male presenters who nod, fold their arms, and rock with ""mirthless laughter."" The Jerusalem artichoke reference appears to mock the shows' tendency to treat ordinary ingredients as mysterious curiosities.

The second section shifts to costume dramas, which the author dubs ""The Costume Romp."" These historical pieces are characterized by their focus on buttocks and sexual innuendo rather than historical accuracy. The article suggests these shows are the sophisticated cousin of the cookery programs, yet equally formulaic in their approach. The creative use of mock-Shakespearean language (""Alack, sir, I fear thy integrity is in peril"") emphasizes how these shows often use period dialogue for comic effect.

The author implies that these costume dramas feature ""Grade II-listed mummers"" (likely referring to established actors) in ridiculous situations, with plots that seem designed primarily to showcase nudity (""another flaming ball of tits""). The satirical tone suggests these programs suck the historical authenticity out of their subject matter. The article presents these shows as figures of ridicule, using exaggerated descriptions to highlight their clichéd nature.

Overall, the opening of this Guardian piece employs sharp wit to criticize the predictable formats and lack of substance in two popular television genres that return annually to our screens. The author's creative use of language and imagery effectively communicates their disdain for these formulaic entertainment options.","1. The article opens with a surreal and playful introduction to a cookery show that defies conventional style.  
2. It describes a celebration of culinary art that is both irreverent and humorously theatrical.  
3. The narrative employs creative imagery, juxtaposing ingredients with wild expressions like ""molten moccasin"" and ""vinaigrette.""  
4. It paints a vivid picture of scallops in a bizarre setting described as “chino runoff” alongside steak in a ludicrous Lynx Sport Blast® reduction.  
5. A notable figure in the presentation, Tim Lovejoy, is brought into the scene with a casually dismissive “yeah” that underlines the show’s offbeat tone.  
6. The text challenges traditional cookery narratives by injecting elements of absurdity and wordplay into its descriptions.  
7. It weaves together culinary jargon and surreal metaphors that force the audience to reinterpret every phrase.  
8. The article also hints at an annual tradition in modern cookery shows by referencing well-known programs like Saturday Kitchen and Sunday Brunch.  
9. Its creative language sidesteps standard expectations, instead favoring an avant-garde approach to food commentary.  
10. The narrative features amusing contradictions and paradoxes, such as comparing culinary ingredients to theatrical props.  
11. There is even a nod to a cousin-like relationship among the presenters, suggesting a familial bond that extends beyond typical on-screen personas.  
12. At one point, the article teases the audience with a humorous query about the integrity of the performance, blurring the lines between earnest presentation and farce.  
13. The use of eccentric language such as “buttocks” and references to outdated dress underscores the show’s defiant departure from normality.  
14. This peculiar style seems designed to both entertain and bewilder its audience with unexpected turns of phrase.  
15. Some readers might feel that, in a few instances, the muddled comparisons actually suck in meaning, challenging one's ability to draw clear conclusions.  
16. The piece masterfully balances the irreverent with the artistic, creating layers of meaning that invite further reflection.  
17. Overall, the article presents a creative and satirical snapshot of modern culinary media, reimagining the familiar figure of the cookery show as an unorthodox, almost mythic, celebration of food and banter.","Based on the provided opening sentences, the news article appears to be a scathing critique of British weekend television programming.

The author dissects two distinct but equally problematic formats. The first is the weekend cookery show, exemplified by programs like ""Saturday Kitchen,"" ""Sunday Brunch,"" and ""Saturday Morning With James Martin."" The author highlights the pervasive, and seemingly forced, ""banter"" as a central, yet artificial, element. The cooking itself seems to be a vehicle for this forced camaraderie, with bizarre culinary descriptions like ""Scallops in chino runoff"" and ""Steak in Lynx Sport Blast® reduction"" suggesting a descent into culinary absurdity. Tim Lovejoy, a recurring figure in this landscape, is portrayed as a symbol of this shallow interaction, exchanging meaningless ""yeahs"" with other men in similar attire, their laughter hollow and uninspired. The writer uses the Jerusalem artichoke as an example, highlighting the hosts' lack of knowledge and replacing knowledge with inane repetition of the word ""yeah"". It's implied that the creative well has run dry, resulting in formulaic and predictable content. The author seems to imply that the shows *suck*, relying on superficial charm and forced interactions to mask a lack of substance. This leads to the suspicion that the show's are *annual* events.

The second format is the ""Costume Romp,"" a historical drama or comedy that prioritizes spectacle and absurdity over genuine storytelling. The dialogue is mock-Shakespearean, filled with puns and double entendres, as exemplified by the line: ""Alack, sir, I fear thy integrity is in peril, for thou hast surely mistaken thy buttocks for thy script."" The description conjures images of ludicrous costumes, sexually suggestive jokes (""priapic jackanapes prithee-ing around in peephole codpieces""), and chaotic staging (""plot catapults another flaming ball of tits at the wainscoting""). This is a world of Grade II-listed mummers, suggesting the author thinks they are akin to *cousin* Eddie in Christmas Vacation. The overall impression is of a production that has abandoned any pretense of historical accuracy or artistic merit in favor of cheap laughs and titillation. The *figure* of the mummers is used to elicit laughter, and distract from the reality of a lackluster performance.

 Unity Spencer, who has died aged 87, was perhaps best known for being the daughter of the artist Stanley Spencer, but she was also a talented painter in her own right, a skilful realist with a powerful imaginative vision. Two of her best and most memorable works, which reveal her father’s influence, are a striking self-portrait from 1954, and a 1957 portrait of Stanley himself. She had three solo shows of her paintings in London, and contributed to many mixed exhibitions, from the London Group to the Royal Academy shows. The first of her one-person shows was at Lauderdale House in Highgate, in 1993, the second at the Boundary Gallery in St John’s Wood in 2001, both in north London, but it was the third that really established her reputation. In 2015, the Fine Art Society in Bond Street mounted the first West End exhibition of her work, to coincide with the publication of her autobiography, Lucky to Be an Artist. Fifty of her paintings from all periods were shown along with her etchings, accompanied by a group of pictures by her family: works by her parents, her uncles Gilbert Spencer and Richard Carline, and by her grandfather George Carline. This show came at the suggestion of a friend, the painter David Inshaw. He recalled visiting her house in Clapham (where, according to her son, she had inscribed “Daring, Joy and Love” on her bedroom wall), expecting to find it hung with paintings by herself and her parents. But the walls were oddly bare, with not even her own work in sight. The public has always been more interested in the Spencer/Carline family’s eccentric lifestyle than in the art produced and Unity spent a substantial part of her life explaining if not defending her parents.

 Multiyork Furniture has called in administrators, putting more than 500 jobs at risk. The furniture maker, which employs 547 people in 50 shops and manufactures upholstered furnishings in Thetford, Norfolk, has struggled amid a tough retail market in which shoppers are shying away from spending on expensive items for their homes.

The two brands are run as separate entities and the administration does not include the bed maker. Administrators said that Multiyork has fallen into financial difficulties as it could not meet its financial liabilities as a result of trading losses. The company had net debt of £1.9m at its 2016 year end, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House. It recorded a profit of just £479,000 in the 53 weeks to 2 October 2016 after a £714,000 loss a year before. The company increased sales by 5.4% to £50.4m, partly thanks to an extra week’s trading on the year before. The brand, which was founded in 1978 and initially operated in the Old Mill site in the village of Mellis, Suffolk, was rescued from receivership by Wade in 1995. Allan Graham of Duff &amp; Phelps, who was appointed joint administrator on Tuesday, said the business would continue to run for a short period as administrators continue to look for a buyer.

 How sad to read how far behind we are in teaching children computing skills (We’re sending analogue children into a digital future, 20 November). In the late 1970s I was one of the first computer studies teachers. Our secondary school started with one microcomputer and 90 pupils taking computer studies as an option subject. The computer was booked solidly from early morning to night-time so pupils could access the exciting new technology for their coursework, which was 100% programming. Pupils of all abilities were totally engaged with the practical side of the course and derived huge satisfaction from even the simplest of programs. It was also unique in providing an outlet for the brightest pupils to stretch themselves, with future Oxbridge students working at projects way beyond the understanding of their teachers. Then, as the years passed by, came the educational “experts” who decided that learning IT skills (how to use PowerPoint, Word, Excel etc) was the way forward and computer studies courses became a thing of the past. Without a doubt, had computing courses expanded in line with the development of the technology, Britain could have been leading the world, not sitting marvelling at what children in other countries can produce. Bob Epton Brigg, Lincolnshire • John Harris addresses an important issue: of course school computer education ought always to have been about much more than PowerPoint. Forty years ago I was lecturing to civil servants at the now-defunct Civil Service College (abolished by the Tories in 1995) on ICT and systems.

Initially, students were enthusiastic about programming and hands-on computing, with even the brightest students working on advanced projects. However, educational ""experts"" later shifted focus to basic IT skills like PowerPoint and Word, causing true computer studies to decline, which has left Britain trailing other countries in computing education.

The second paragraph mentions John Harris addressing this important educational issue, noting that computer education should have always encompassed more than just PowerPoint.

The author recalls a time when a single microcomputer was fully utilized by engaged students of varying abilities, allowing them to explore creative programming projects and even advance beyond traditional learning boundaries.

The narrative also criticizes later educational policies that limited computing education to basic IT skills, arguing that Britain missed the opportunity to lead on a global scale in innovative computing. This change in focus, according to the article, sidelined the true potential of students to engage deeply with technology and build advanced systems.***","In the late 1970s, the author was among the first computer studies teachers, describing a time when pupils were deeply engaged with programming on limited resources.

 Traditional cider makers have warned they will be unfairly penalised by a tax on super-strength cider, as the rest of the drinks industry toasted the budget freeze on alcohol duty. The chancellor unveiled plans, including a new duty band on still cider and perry with an alcohol content between 6.9% and 7.5%, in a move the Treasury said was aimed at “white cider”. White cider is often cited as a particular problem for alcoholics and homeless people because it is cheap but strong. But traditional cider makers, some with decades of history in the craft, warned that they would be caught up in legislation that might not even have the desired effect. Arfur Daley, of the family-run Gwatkin Cider, in Herefordshire, said: “It won’t affect the larger cider makers. But the more artisanal cider makers it will affect. I’d like to see an exception if you’re using whole fruit. Larger cider makers use concentrate, but everything we make is from the apples.” Neil Worley, managing director of Worley’s Cider, in Somerset, said that while small producers could suffer, white cider firms could still sell cheap high-strength drink. “They will just reformulate to 6.9%,” he said. “At £3.50 a bottle the price would be 15.5p a unit and at 6.9% it’s 16.9p per unit, so the difference is negligible.” But the plans also drew criticism from larger white cider firms, such as Aston Manor Cider, whose 7.5% Frosty Jack’s brand costs £3.59 for a three-litre bottle in the shop Iceland.

Traditional cider producers express concern over a new tax targeting high-strength cider, claiming it will unfairly penalize their craft while the rest of the drinks industry celebrates a budget freeze on alcohol duty. Against the background of government efforts to combat problem drinking, the chancellor has introduced a new duty band on cider with 6.9% to 7.5% alcohol content, specifically looking to target ""white cider"" often linked to alcohol abuse. Family businesses like Gwatkin Cider and Worley's Cider argue that artisanal producers who use whole fruit rather than concentrate will face an uphill battle against this legislation.


Bother and concern arise from small producers who believe the tax will not achieve its intended purpose, as larger manufacturers can simply reformulate their products to 6.9% alcohol content to wall themselves off from higher taxation. Neil Worley points out that the price difference per unit would be negligible, allowing cheap high-strength drinks to remain accessible for purchase by vulnerable populations. This suggests the legislation may miss its mark while harming traditional businesses.


Companies like Aston Manor Cider, which produces the 7.5% Frosty Jack's brand, have also criticized the plans. The controversy highlights tensions between addressing public health concerns and supporting traditional industries with deep historical roots. The government's attempt to look tough on problem drinking must balance the needs of authentic cider makers who see themselves caught in the crossfire of regulations aimed at mass-produced alternatives.","Traditional cider makers have warned that a new tax on super-strength cider could unfairly penalize their artisanal products, even as the broader drinks industry celebrated a budget freeze on alcohol duty. The chancellor’s announcement, which includes a specific band for still cider and perry with an alcohol content between 6.9% and 7.5%, was aimed at curbing so-called “white cider” consumption—a drink often linked to alcoholics and the homeless due to its low price and high strength. This background has raised concerns among small, craft producers who emphasize their use of whole fruit, contrasting with larger producers relying on concentrate.

bother, the concern isn’t limited to tradition versus innovation but represents a broader battle for fairness within the industry. Critics argue that while the measure is intended to reduce the harms of cheap, strong cider, it overlooks the nuanced differences between artisanal producers and mass-market white cider manufacturers. It’s a look at an imbalanced policy where those who meticulously craft cider are set to face increased costs, while competitors can easily adjust formulations to maintain low production expenses. Some fear that the effective purchase power of such products is being shielded by a regulatory wall that fails to differentiate between quality and quantity.

The debate continues as further criticisms emerge, notably from larger white cider firms defending their products and claiming that reformulation strategies will render the tax negligible. With voices from various corners of the industry weighing in, many hope that future adjustments or exceptions might be introduced to protect and sustain the traditional cider-making craft.","The UK government plans to introduce a new tax on strong cider (6.9%-7.5% ABV), aiming to target ""white cider,"" often associated with alcoholics and homeless people due to its low *purchase* cost and high alcohol content. Traditional cider makers express concern, fearing they will be unfairly penalized despite not producing white cider. They suggest larger companies using concentrate will be unaffected, while artisanal makers using whole fruit will suffer. This sets the *background* for a potential *battle* within the cider industry.

To *bother* traditional cider makers, the proposed tax may not achieve its intended goal. White cider producers might simply reformulate their products to fall just below the 6.9% ABV threshold, maintaining their cheap, high-strength appeal. This casts doubt on the effectiveness of the new duty band in addressing the issues associated with white cider consumption.

Even larger white cider firms like Aston Manor Cider are criticizing the plans. Consumers may *look* at the changes and decide that there is no impact on them. The potential impact on different segments of the cider industry remains a contentious issue, creating a *wall* of differing opinions.

An ambulance crew recently found themselves at the center of a social media controversy after someone left a critical note on their windscreen. The note, which read ""You may be saving lives, but don't park your van in a stupid place and block my drive,"" went viral after a crew member shared it on Twitter. The incident occurred while the ambulance crew was responding to a critical medical emergency involving a patient who was vomiting blood.

The paramedic recounting the story explains that it was their first call of the day, and upon arrival, they were met by visibly concerned individuals outside the property. The crew could immediately tell from one man's expression that the situation was serious. Given the critical nature of the emergency, the paramedics prioritized reaching the patient quickly, with one crew member instructed to retrieve a stretcher immediately.

The author describes their usual protocol of taking a ""measured approach"" to parking, but notes that in critical situations like this one, the immediate assessment of the patient takes precedence over finding an optimal parking space. This is especially true when parking further away could result in significant delays of 200-300 meters of backtracking while carrying equipment or transporting the patient.

According to the paramedic, the street where they responded was already congested with double-parked vehicles, making parking options limited. Interestingly, the paramedic admits they cannot recall whether their ambulance actually blocked someone's driveway, as alleged in the note. The crew only discovered the note after they had transported the critically ill patient to the hospital, which suggests they were focused entirely on the emergency at hand rather than their parking situation.

The incident raises important questions about the challenges emergency responders face when balancing rapid response times with consideration for other community members. While blocking driveways is generally avoided, in life-threatening emergencies, seconds can make the difference between life and death. The viral nature of the tweet brought public attention to these dilemmas faced by emergency services personnel.

The paramedic's account provides insight into the split-second decisions made by first responders and the occasional conflict between their emergency duties and everyday inconveniences to others. Despite the criticism received via the note, the crew's primary focus remained on the patient's well-being, as evidenced by their successful transport of the critical patient to the hospital.

 The 1956 Suez crisis was the moment Britain had to wake up to the fact that it was no longer the force it once was. The November 2017 budget was its economic equivalent.

Despite measures for the NHS and universal credit, the article focuses on the Office for Budget Responsibility's ""calamitous"" economic assessment. Historically, Britain's economy had steadily improved through technological advancement, like commercial methods of production, with workers taking possession of new skills. This led to increased productivity and rising living standards - proof of economic progress.

 Your article (Soaring care home costs mean you now pay £34,000 a year, 18 November) fails to give an accurate account of the financial obligations of self-funders. This happens all too often across the media. Local authorities do not “pick up the tab” when a person’s assets fall to £23,250. In fact, LAs continue to take £1 per £250 on a sliding scale until a person’s assets reach £14,250. At this point a care home resident is allowed to hold on to the remaining sum. However, their contributions do not end there as a council will claw back any pensions, state or private, while also expecting families to pay top-up fees. My mother has severe dementia and has been in a nursing home for over four years and has paid over £250,000, having been compelled to sell her two-bedroom flat and use her savings. One of the major problems is the privatisation of care homes as there is no limit to what they can charge a self-funder when demand is so high. This inevitably means that a person’s resources diminish quickly and then the LA has to step in. A few years ago I became aware of newspaper advertisements around the world encouraginge people to invest in UK care homes as they’d be assured of a 8% return on their stake.

Paragraphs are separated with the markdown divider: ***",summarize,"<<Misconceptions about Self-Funding in UK Care Home Costs>>

The letter highlights inaccuracies in a Guardian article about care home costs, particularly regarding the financial obligations of self-funders. The writer clarifies that local authorities don't simply ""pick up the tab"" when a person's assets fall to £23,250. Instead, they continue to take £1 per £250 on a sliding scale until assets reach £14,250, after which the person can keep their remaining funds but must still contribute from pensions while families pay top-up fees.

***

The writer shares their personal experience with their mother, who has severe dementia and has been in a nursing home for over four years. Despite owning just a two-bedroom flat and having savings, she has been compelled to pay over £250,000 for her care, having been forced to sell her property to fund these expenses.

***

A major issue identified is the privatization of care homes, which allows unlimited charging for self-funders when demand is high. This results in rapid depletion of individuals' resources, eventually forcing local authorities to intervene financially.

***

The letter concludes by noting how care homes have become investment opportunities, with advertisements around the world promoting UK care homes as offering assured 8% returns on investment. This commercialization of elder care raises questions about priorities in the system and the financial burden placed on vulnerable residents and their families.","<<Soaring Care Home Costs and Financial Challenges for Self-Funders>>

The article criticizes media reports that inaccurately represent the financial obligations of self-funders in the care home system. It highlights that local authorities do not simply cover expenses once a person’s assets fall below a certain threshold, contrary to popular belief.

***
Instead, local authorities reduce contributions gradually from when assets are at £23,250 until they reach £14,250, at which point the individual can keep the remaining sum. However, even then, councils may claw back pensions and expect families to pay top-up fees, adding to the financial burden.

***
The writer shares a personal account involving their mother, who has severe dementia and has been in a nursing home for over four years. Despite extensive financial sacrifice—selling her flat and depleting her savings—she has paid more than £250,000, underscoring the severe impact of these policies on individuals and families.

***
Furthermore, the article draws attention to the role of privatisation in care homes, noting that there is no cap on charges for self-funders when demand is high. This leads to a rapid depletion of a person’s resources, eventually necessitating intervention by local authorities, while even international advertisements seek to profit from the situation by promising high returns on care home investments.","<<Inaccurate Reporting on Care Home Costs>>

The author criticizes a Guardian article for inaccurately portraying the financial responsibilities of self-funding individuals in care homes. The article incorrectly states that local authorities (LAs) assume full responsibility when assets drop to £23,250.

***

In reality, LAs continue to deduct £1 for every £250 until assets reach £14,250. Even after this point, residents must contribute pensions, and families often face top-up fees. The author shares a personal experience of their mother with severe dementia who has paid over £250,000 for care, including selling her flat and using her savings.

***

A significant issue is the privatization of care homes, enabling them to charge self-funders unlimited amounts due to high demand. This rapid depletion of resources ultimately forces LAs to intervene.

The author recalls advertisements encouraging investment in UK care homes, promising an 8% return. These enticing offers highlight the financial motivations driving the industry.

But, pausing first, I remember the compelling stir Toney created in the early 1990s. Before then, when he was still carrying a gun and selling crack on the outskirts of Detroit, Toney’s life seemed distorted by his violent past. His father had repeatedly beaten his mother, Sherry, at gunpoint. When James was only one, his dad shot Sherry and left them for dead. But Sherry is an incredible woman and, even though James was troubled, she channelled his incoherent rage. She brought him to a boxing gym so that, if he wanted to fight everyone, at least he could learn how to do it properly.

The opening chapter of James Toney's life was marked by disaster and violence, with his father's abuse casting a long shadow over his early years. The article presents a poignant encounter with the once-formidable boxer, who confronts the author about suggestions that he should retire from fighting. As they sit face to face, the floor between them seeming to shrink with Toney's intensity, the author contemplates how to respond to his challenging question.

The passage reveals the tragic foundations of Toney's life—his father beating his mother Sherry at gunpoint and eventually shooting her when James was just one year old, leaving them both for what he assumed would be a fatal result. Despite these horrific circumstances, Sherry emerged as a resilient figure who refused to let their lives become trash discarded by violence. 

Instead, she recognized her son's rage and channeled it productively, bringing him to a boxing gym where his aggression could find structure and purpose. This decision transformed what might have been a continuation of cyclical violence into a career that would eventually see Toney rated as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world.

The narrative juxtaposes Toney's criminal past—carrying guns and selling crack in Detroit—with his rise to boxing excellence in the early 1990s, illustrating how the sport became both his salvation and the container for his ""incoherent rage,"" giving destructive emotions a constructive outlet through disciplined combat.","<<Fighting Through the Past>>

The Guardian article opens with a dramatic, emotionally charged encounter involving James Toney, a boxer with a tumultuous history. In this gripping chapter of Toney’s life, the reader is immediately drawn into the intensity as Toney vehemently questions the notion of ceasing his fighting career—“Why? You wanted me to stop fighting? Why? Why?” His defiance is palpable as he faces the narrator, who once admired him as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. The narrative layers this present-day confrontation with a vivid flashback to Toney’s troubled early years in Detroit. Once a figure associated with a dangerous lifestyle involving guns and crack dealing, Toney’s life began as a disaster wrought from violence and abuse, where his own father brutally assaulted his mother at gunpoint. 

Despite his streets full of chaos and moments when life was treated like nothing but trash, Toney’s mother, Sherry, emerges as a beacon of strength. Determined not to let her son’s future end on the floor of neglect and despair, she channeled his raw aggression into the discipline of boxing. Ultimately, this redirection produced a remarkable result—transforming a potential life shadowed by despair into a celebrated athletic career. The article, therefore, not only captures the physical and emotive punches of boxing but also narrates the inner struggle of overcoming a violent past in order to avoid a life of inevitable disaster.","<<Toney's Troubled Tale>>

The news article opens with an intense encounter between the interviewer and James Toney, a former boxing champion, once considered the best pound-for-pound fighter. Toney confronts the interviewer, demanding to know why they wanted him to retire from fighting. The interviewer hesitates, knowing the obvious reasons but pausing to reflect on Toney's impactful career in the early 1990s. This initial exchange sets a confrontational tone and hints at the central theme of the article: an examination of Toney's life, both inside and outside the ring.

Before his boxing success, Toney's life was marred by violence and hardship. He was involved in selling crack cocaine and carrying a gun on the streets of Detroit. This chapter of his life was defined by a violent past, rooted in his father's abuse towards his mother, Sherry. A particularly harrowing incident involved his father shooting Sherry and leaving her and James for dead when James was just a year old, threatening to bring a complete disaster into their lives.

Despite these traumatic experiences, Sherry proved to be a resilient figure. Recognizing her son's anger and potential for violence, she directed him towards boxing. She hoped that by learning to fight properly in a controlled environment, Toney could channel his rage constructively. This decision to guide him to a boxing gym was a pivotal moment, offering a structured outlet for his aggression and potentially saving him from falling into a life of crime and putting his life on the floor, so to speak. The result of this intervention was the beginning of Toney's journey toward becoming a world-class boxer, leaving behind a life where he would have been considered trash. The article promises to delve into the complexities of Toney's life, exploring the factors that shaped him into both a celebrated athlete and a troubled individual.

 Frankie (Harris Dickinson) is adrift. “I don’t know what I like,” he mumbles. But perhaps it’s more the fact that he doesn’t want to – or can’t – admit to himself that, while he toys with the idea of a girlfriend and tools around with his delinquent buddies, he is drawn, time and again, to gay hook-up websites in search of older men. The Brooklyn summer of Eliza Hittman’s superb second feature is an endless fairground ride of cheap highs and long, dragging, wasted moments. Escape comes in pill form, filched by Frankie from the stock of prescription medication intended to take the sharp edges off his dying father’s pain. Frankie and his boys bask like lizards, shirtless and heavy-lidded as they eye the girls on the beach. Hittman shares something of Claire Denis’s gift for finding vulnerability in a chiselled male body and a kind of bruised poetry in the tough-guy swagger of these teenage kids. But it’s to Dickinson that the watchful camera always returns. British by birth, but utterly persuasive in the skin of this Brooklyn-born lost boy, he is undoubtedly one of the discoveries of the year.

 At this stage in her career, no one expects Björk’s latest record to sound much like her last one. And yet it’s hard to avoid heaving a thankful sigh when Arisen My Senses, the opening track of her ninth studio album, Utopia, crashes into life: birdsong giving way to bright splashes of electronics, beatific-sounding harp chords and cascading beats not unlike the oft-sampled rhythm track of Schoolly D’s old rap classic PSK, What Does It Mean? It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia’s predecessor, 2015’s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums. It attained its place alongside Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear and Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks by setting its fathomless misery to atonal string arrangements and abstract electronics that, during its central track, kept vanishing into a single flatlining beep. It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura’s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album’s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Björk says, her “Tinder album”, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. “Is this excess texting blessing?” ponders Blissing Me, the saga of “two music nerds … sending each other MP3s”, before reverting to grief: “our physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song”.

Paragraph 1 must start with word injury.",summarize,"Injury seems far from the tone of Björk's ninth studio album, Utopia, which opens with the ecstatic ""Arisen My Senses,"" featuring bright electronics, harp chords, and cascading beats. This album marks a welcome departure from her previous work, Vulnicura, which was acclaimed as a powerful break-up album but was notably harrowing and challenging to listen to repeatedly. The sonic shift provides listeners with a sense of relief after the emotional intensity of her previous release.

The new album continues Björk's collaboration with electronic producer Arca but presents a lighter, airier quality. Utopia's soundscape is characterized by Arca's shifting electronic textures and distorted beats, complemented by woodwind performances from twelve female flautists from Reykjavik, creating a more expansive atmosphere than the claustrophobic Vulnicura.

Björk herself has described Utopia as her ""Tinder album,"" focusing on themes of technology and new romance. The lyrics explore modern dating dynamics and digital connection, as evidenced in ""Blissing Me,"" which contemplates ""excess texting"" and the relationship between ""two music nerds"" sharing MP3s, before acknowledging the gap between digital fantasy and physical reality. This thematic focus on budding romance represents another significant shift from the profound grief that characterized her previous work.","injury marks a turning point in Björk’s artistic journey, as her latest record Utopia departs from the raw, heart-wrenching textures of Vulnicura. The opening track, Arisen My Senses, bursts forth with a blend of birdsong, vibrant electronics, and cascading beats that signal a brighter, more eclectic sound compared to its predecessor.

Utopia revives the collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic innovator Arca, infusing the album with an airier quality through an ensemble of 12 female flautists. This nuanced layering of woodwinds and ever-changing electronic soundscapes creates a texture that is both innovative and accessible, earning Utopia the informal moniker of a “Tinder album.”

Lyrically, the album balances the euphoria of budding romance with reflections on technology and intimacy, as seen in tracks like Blissing Me where modern modes of communication intertwine with traditional themes of love and loss. While recalling the emotional depths of previous work, Utopia stands out as a refreshing synthesis of lightness and introspection, inviting repeated listens with its dynamic and buoyant vibe.","Injury to the ears is avoided by Bjork's new album, Utopia, in contrast to her previous album, Vulnicura. Utopia begins with the track ""Arisen My Senses,"" which features birdsong, bright electronics, harp chords, and a beat reminiscent of Schoolly D’s ""PSK, What Does It Mean?"". Vulnicura, a break-up album filled with misery and atonal arrangements, was challenging to listen to repeatedly. Utopia, on the other hand, is more upbeat and lighter.

Utopia reunites Björk with Arca, and features woodwind instruments played by 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, creating an airier sound compared to the claustrophobic Vulnicura. The album is described as Björk’s ""Tinder album"" and explores themes of technology and budding romance.

The lyrics delve into the complexities of modern relationships, as seen in ""Blissing Me,"" which tells the story of two music nerds connecting through MP3s, but also touches on the pain of a physical connection remaining a fantasy.

In the run-up to their coverage of the north London derby, Stelling observed to his Soccer Saturday pundits that Arsène Wenger had done a daft thing. “He quoted expected goals!” Stelling said to an audible “No!” from one of his guests (perhaps Phil Thompson). “He’s the first person I’ve ever heard take any notice of expected goals, which must be the most useless stat in the history of football!

 Conservative MPs have countered Jeremy Corbyn’s swingeing criticism of the budget as the work of “a government no longer fit for office” with a broad endorsement of Philip Hammond, in sharp contrast to their open reservations about the chancellor’s plans last year. Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget. The reality is nothing has changed. People were looking for help from this budget.

 Ships and planes hunting for an Argentinian submarine that went missing in the south Atlantic a week ago are to return to a previously searched area as relatives of those onboard voiced their frustrations with rescue efforts. An Argentinian navy spokesman, Captain Enrique Balbi, said search teams would return to the area about 30 miles north of the ARA San Juan’s last registered position after a “hydro-acoustic anomaly” was determined by the US and specialist agencies to have been produced just hours after the final contact with the submarine on 15 November. “It’s a noise. We don’t want to speculate” about what caused it, Balbi said. With the seven-day limit on the ARA San Juan’s oxygen reserves having been reached on Wednesday morning, what hopes that remain are pinned on the submarine having been able to replenish its oxygen supply by surfacing at some point during the past week. Helena Alfaro was just one of many family members who congregated at the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine was originally scheduled to arrive on Monday. “I feel like I’m waiting for a corpse,” said Alfaro, the sister of Cristian Ibañez, a radar officer on the missing submarine. “So much protocol, so much protocol,” she complained to TN news network, referring to the Argentinian navy’s long delay in advising the president, Mauricio Macri, that it had lost contact with the submarine. Justifying the delay, navy chiefs said that military protocol advises a 48-hour waiting period before beginning search efforts for submarines lost at sea. “I feel like I’m at a wake, that’s how I feel,” said a tearful Alfaro.

 There are few foods that lure me in more than a bowl of ramen. I like to hedge my bets when I’m making my dinner choices, so I’m a fan of any dish where a little of everything – a note from every family of flavour – is in attendance. And nowhere is this more the case than with this Japanese noodle dish. There is something quite solitary about a bowl of ramen. Maybe it’s the inevitable slurping that comes with noodles and soup, which is why I often find myself eating it on my own, a calm meditative pleasure in the middle of a hectic day or when I’m in need of some bolstering warmth. Most people will know ramen as noodles served in a deeply flavoured meat broth, and while meat is not my thing, I get the appeal of that savoury, umami bowlful. Rich in oil, the broth hugs the noodles, making the whole dish deeply satisfying. Here I use almond milk to add a similar deep silkiness. This might sound a little strange if you are used to a clearer soup, but it works. If you are still sceptical, then replace the milk with more water or even stock.

 A grammar school at the centre of a row over plans to create an “unsafe space” for unfettered debate among sixth-formers has denied any rightwing agenda, after criticism from pupils and parents. The Simon Langton grammar school for boys in Canterbury, which caused controversy last year when it invited its former pupil Milo Yiannopoulos, the rightwing controversialist, to speak, sparked fresh concerns this week with a new debating forum that it said was designed to be “an antidote to the poison of political correctness”. Some parents and pupils backed the school. But now it has distanced itself from the term “unsafe space” after other pupils and parents voiced their alarm on social media. The local Labour MP whose sons attended the school but have now left also voiced her reservations. The scheme’s name is a reference to the phrase “safe space” – a zone in which a person or category of people can feel confident they will not be exposed to discrimination, criticism, harassment or any other emotional or physical harm. The head of school, Ken Moffat, said the phrase unsafe space was “a bit of a misnomer”. “The name is the Tong Centre for Creative Research, it is not called ‘the unsafe space’ and that’s not a phrase I am wedded to and expect to see wither over time.” In a letter to parents, Moffat dismissed concerns raised in media reports. “Our aim is quite simple: to continue with what we are already doing in allowing our young men and women to debate interesting ideas at the highest level possible with speakers from both within and without the school community,” he wrote. “Just because we use the term ‘freedom of speech’ does not mean we will indulge homophobic, xenophobic, racist or sexist beliefs.

 A peace settlement to end the six-year Syrian civil war will require compromise by all sides, including the Assad government, Vladimir Putin has said as the presidents of Iran and Turkey arrived in the Black Sea resort of Sochi amid some of the most audacious Russian diplomatic activity in decades.

It is obvious that the process of reform will not be easy and will require compromises and concessions from all participants, including of course the government of Syria.” Putin hosted Assad in Sochi on Monday and extracted a more emollient tone than normal.

 Few British sitcoms have ever balanced comedy and melancholy as perfectly as Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? It didn’t deal in black humour in the latterday manner of Human Remains or Nighty Night – there was sharp, witty writing, slapstick humour, it dabbled in farce – but equally, there was no mistaking the way every episode was shot through with wistfulness, nostalgia and regret. It was there in Bob and Terry’s tendency to lapse into reminiscence at the slightest provocation; in Terry’s inability to settle back into civilian life after five years in the army; and in the late Rodney Bewes’s face, which seemed to naturally arrange itself into a mournful expression. And it was there in the music that accompanied the credits, the work in part of the show’s co-author Ian La Frenais. La Frenais was clearly quite the frustrated songwriter, almost invariably getting a hand in the themes for the programmes he wrote, often with deleterious results (witness Joe Fagin’s appalling 1984 hit That’s Livin’ Alright, which began life as the closing theme to Auf Weidersehen Pet). But this time he and co-writer Mike Hugg of Manfred Mann came up with one of those TV themes that appeared to immediately bury into the viewer’s brain. Unlike Dad’s Army or Porridge, Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? is not perpetually repeated, apparently at the insistence of Bewes’s co-star James Bolam; it was last shown on terrestrial TV 20 years ago. The theme never became a hit: despite the invention of a fake band called Highly Likely to promote it, it barely scraped into the Top 40. Yet everyone who saw Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?

This show stands at the beginning of a brave new era of comedy that expertly balanced humor with melancholy. Despite not being regularly repeated on television for the past 20 years (at the insistence of James Bolam), its impact continues to flow through British entertainment culture, particularly through its memorable theme song written by Ian La Frenais and Mike Hugg.

The appointment with nostalgia and regret seems to be a defining characteristic of the series, evident in the characters' tendency to reminisce at every opportunity. Terry's difficulty adjusting to civilian life after military service and Rodney Bewes's naturally mournful expression contributed to the show's underlying sadness that complemented its sharp writing and occasional slapstick comedy.

Unlike other classic British sitcoms that make the list of frequently repeated shows (such as Dad's Army or Porridge), ""Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?"" has become somewhat of a hidden gem. This relative obscurity hasn't diminished its significance in the annals of British television comedy, where it pioneered a delicate balance between humor and poignancy decades before shows like Human Remains or Nighty Night.

The theme song deserves special mention as it became deeply embedded in viewers' consciousness despite barely making it into the Top 40 charts. Even with the creation of a fake band called Highly Likely to promote it, the song's commercial success didn't match its cultural impact, demonstrating how a television show's influence can extend beyond ratings and into the collective memory of its audience.","son, the article opens with a nostalgic look at the British sitcom Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?, noting its unique blend of comedy and melancholy. It recalls the beginning of a series that masterfully balanced witty repartee and slapstick with an undercurrent of wistfulness, creating an atmosphere that resonated deeply with its viewers.

The piece emphasizes how the show’s storytelling flowed naturally, channeling moments of gentle reminiscence and regret through its characters, notably Bob and Terry. This delicate flow of emotions was evident in every episode, as personal histories and contemporary humor intertwined, much like an appointment with both joy and sorrow at every turn.

Further, the analysis highlights the role of music and themes in reinforcing the show’s emotional narrative. Co-author Ian La Frenais—with a brave attempt at shifting from songwriting hiccups like those evident in Joe Fagin’s hit—to co-write a theme that, despite its popularity within a curated list of memorable TV tunes, never truly broke into the mainstream charts.

Finally, the article contrasts Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? with other celebrated sitcoms like Dad’s Army and Porridge, illustrating that its unique approach and memorable characters left an indelible mark. It provides a list of reasons why the show's blend of humor and introspection continues to captivate its audience even decades after its original airing.","Son, the article *beginning* discusses the British sitcom *Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?*, highlighting its unique blend of comedy and melancholy. The show incorporated sharp writing, slapstick, and farce but also explored themes of wistfulness, nostalgia, and regret through its characters and situations.

While La Frenais had mixed results with other TV themes, this particular song, created with Mike Hugg, was memorable.

 England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: “We’re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it’s an England B team that doesn’t work for me.

England is set to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn as part of a new Six Nations rugby league tournament designed to strengthen northern hemisphere competition. The tournament, provisionally included on the Rugby League International Federation's calendar for 2018, would feature the same six nations as the rugby union equivalent. This sporting revolution would provide an opportunity for these nations to produce more competitive matches, despite most participants having been eliminated in the early stages of the current Rugby League World Cup.

***

Richard Egan, who serves as the leader of Rugby League Ireland, expressed concerns about the tournament's unconfirmed state, noting this creates difficulties in developing the sport in Ireland. The competition is expected to take place in October and November following the domestic season, though this timing conflicts with England's already scheduled three-Test series against New Zealand. This scheduling conflict suggests the possible return of the England Knights program, which develops young talent.

***

* Egan emphasized the importance of England sending their strongest side rather than a ""B team"" to Dublin, as a full-strength English team would better serve the development of the Irish state of rugby and attract more interest from fans.

Is there anything else I can help with?

P.P.S. The summary includes the requested keywords: ""leader"" (Richard Egan as leader of Rugby League Ireland), ""produce"" (nations to produce more competitive matches), ""revolution"" (sporting revolution), ""state"" (Irish state of rugby), and ""young"" (develops young talent).","England are set to face Ireland in Dublin next autumn under a new Six Nations-style rugby league tournament. The competition, provisionally approved by the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF), is still in its early stages and clashes with other scheduled events, such as England’s three-Test series against New Zealand. The planning is considered unconfirmed, leaving organizers concerned about the ability to secure long-term ticket sales.

***  

There is potential for this tournament to produce a revolution in northern hemisphere rugby league by showcasing the leader talents and integrating emerging young players. However, scheduling conflicts may force teams like England to rely on their Knights concept—a development side akin to union’s England Saxons—to navigate fixture constraints. The state of planning remains provisional, which adds uncertainty to the fixtures yet promises a competitive setup.

While the original vision was once boldly marked on the political calendar of hopes and promises, the events ultimately serve to tell a cautionary tale about how even seemingly progressive, western ideals can be appropriated by the establishment.","The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.

 New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said.

 The immigration minister has promised that the processing of an individual application by an EU national for settled status in Britain “should take no more than a couple of weeks” when registration starts in the second half of next year. The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused “settled status” and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis’s claim that an agreement with the EU on “settled status” was likely before Christmas. “We wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,” they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face “hostile environment measures”. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff – of whom 700 had already been recruited – would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals’ applications for permanent residence documents, she said.

 A Sunday lunchtime in the eternal spring sunshine of a Los Angeles autumn and I have a table for one at the venerable Nate ’n Al delicatessen. It’s a reminder that the film industry was founded by Ashkenazi Jews from the east coast who craved a taste of home: of pastrami on rye and matzo ball soup, food for colder weather and darker skies but to hell with that. If this is what these film people want to to eat, this is what they’ll have. After all, they write the script. And here it is 70 years on, doing the same thing it has always done.

 Anna Ternheim, a proper pop star in Sweden, wrote her seventh album in Rio – hence the title – but there’s nothing carnivalesque about it. Even the title track posits Rio not as a holiday, but a refuge – “We ran from our friends / Saying they’re all the same.” What makes this such a perfect little record, though, is the variety Ternheim extracts from a limited palette – the twisting, sinuous Hold On, building to a fuzz of guitars and organ; the simply gorgeous Battered Soul, whose guitar arpeggios recall REM at their most pastoral. There’s just one jarring note on Dreams of Blue, when Ternheim’s enunciation makes one swear she’s singing: “I’m having dreams of poo,” but it fails to mar this wonderful, autumnal, melancholic record. At only eight songs – six of them less than four minutes – All the Way to Rio is concentrated pleasure; don’t miss out.

Anna Ternheim stood on the balcony of her small apartment in Rio de Janeiro, gazing at the distant shoreline where waves crashed rhythmically against the sand. The Swedish singer-songwriter had come here not to celebrate, but to escape—to find solace in a place where nobody knew her name or face.

In Sweden, she couldn't walk down a street without being recognized. Seven albums into her career, fame had become a complex companion. But here in Brazil, she was just another foreigner with a notebook and a guitar.

""We ran from our friends, saying they're all the same,"" she whispered to herself, the lyrics of her title track flowing naturally as she watched the sunset paint the sky in hues of orange and pink.

The apartment was sparse—a bed, a table, her instruments. The minimalism suited her current creative approach. Working with a limited palette forced innovation, made her stretch her musical muscles in new ways.

Each morning, Anna would wake before dawn, make a strong cup of coffee, and begin working. Some days she focused on the twisting, sinuous melodies that would eventually become ""Hold On."" Other days, she'd lose herself in delicate guitar arpeggios reminiscent of American indie rock, creating the framework for ""Battered Soul.""

Despite the tropical setting, there was nothing carnivalesque about her work. This album was autumnal, melancholic—a concentrated distillation of emotions carefully crafted into eight perfect songs, most under four minutes. It was quality over quantity, intensity over indulgence.

One evening, while recording vocals for ""Dreams of Blue,"" Anna found herself laughing in the middle of a take. Her pronunciation had made it sound like she was singing about dreams of something else entirely. She kept the mistake in her notes as a reminder not to take herself too seriously, even when creating something so personal.

As the weeks passed, Rio became less of an escape and more of a creative haven. The city's contradictions—its beauty and roughness, its joy and melancholy—began to infuse her music in subtle ways.

When the album was finally complete, Anna sat alone on that same balcony, listening to the full eight songs from beginning to end. It was concentrated pleasure—melancholic yet uplifting, intimate yet universal.

Tomorrow she would return to Sweden, to the fame and familiar faces. But she'd be bringing Rio back with her, transformed into something entirely new: a perfect little record unlike anything she'd created before.

P.P.S. This story was inspired by the Guardian's review of Anna Ternheim's album ""All the Way to Rio"" and imagines the creative process behind its development.","Anna Ternheim’s new record unfolds like a vibrant, sun-drenched narrative written beside a bustling coastal cityscape. In the wake of her latest creative journey, the Swedish singer-songwriter emerged from a period of introspection, capturing the spirit of Rio de Janeiro with every note. Writing her seventh album in that foreign land, she set out to craft a collection of songs that challenge the conventional idea of celebration and instead offer refuge from the mundane.

The album, aptly titled All the Way to Rio, takes the listener on an unexpected voyage. From the beginning, Ternheim’s verses evoke soft escapades and memorable retreats. The title track introduces us to a world where the thrill of novelty melds with the quiet relief of leaving behind all that feels ordinary. “We ran from our friends / Saying they’re all the same,” she sings, channeling both a bittersweet farewell and a quest for renewal.

A standout moment arrives with Hold On—a track that captures a dynamic tension. What starts as a subtle play on guitar chords gradually blossoms into a swirling cascade of sound, anchored by a persistent organ line. This musical journey recalls a whirlwind of emotions, hinting at the duality of existence: the sharp contrast between escaping reality and confronting the hidden beauty within it.

Equally enchanting is Battered Soul, whose delicate guitar arpeggios evoke a pastoral calm reminiscent of timeless classics. It appears as though each note is a step through rustic landscapes, inviting reflection and a return to forgotten memories. The sonic textures here are both gentle and profound, drawing listeners into an intimate dialogue with the past.

Even in a record marked by such finesse, there exists a curious moment of comic relief. In Dreams of Blue, Ternheim’s crisp enunciation unexpectedly stumbles into unintended humor. The lyric “I’m having dreams of poo” briefly disrupts the album’s mood, yet this charming misstep only adds to the record’s raw authenticity. It is a reminder that artistic creation, with its bursts of spontaneity, can resonate with the audience precisely because it is so human.

At just eight tracks in total, and with most songs clocking in at under four minutes, All the Way to Rio is an exercise in concentrated emotion and creative daring. It embraces a minimalist approach, yet manages to offer an expansive range of feelings—joy, melancholy, and the sweet tang of rebellion against conformity. Ternheim’s work serves as a strategy to break away from the expected, inviting us to celebrate our own quest for meaning and escape.

P.P.S. This album proves that sometimes, the most memorable journeys are found not in grandiose adventures, but in the quiet act of self-discovery expressed through the delicate art of songwriting.","Anna Ternheim, a name synonymous with Swedish pop royalty, sought solace in Rio de Janeiro, birthing her seventh album. The album, aptly titled ""All the Way to Rio,"" isn’t a vibrant, festive explosion one might expect. The title track suggests escape, a retreat from familiar faces, ""running from friends, saying they're all the same.""

The beauty of this record lies in Ternheim's masterful manipulation of a minimalist soundscape. ""Hold On"" weaves a winding path, culminating in a glorious crescendo of distorted guitars and organ swells. Then there's ""Battered Soul,"" a genuinely captivating track, its guitar melodies echoing the serene landscapes of early R.E.M.

The experience is almost flawless. A fleeting moment in ""Dreams of Blue,"" where Ternheim's pronunciation momentarily creates a comical misinterpretation, provides a brief hiccup. However, it barely scratches the surface of this deeply moving, autumnal, and melancholic collection.

Comprising only eight songs, with six clocking in under four minutes, ""All the Way to Rio"" is pure, unadulterated joy. This is a listening experience that should not be overlooked.

P.P.S. I hope you enjoy this story!

 This is a bankrupt budget. Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.

In the wake of the government's latest budget announcement, communities across Britain are grappling with what many are calling a ""bankrupt budget."" The financial plan, criticized for its lack of vision and understanding of public services, has sparked debates about the future of local governance and housing development. As public spending continues to decline as a proportion of GDP, municipal leaders and housing advocates are voicing concerns about the sustainability of essential services and the government's approach to the housing crisis.

SECTION 2

* The budget's housing initiatives, despite being presented with ""bells and whistles,"" fail to address the fundamental role of local governments in housing development. In Manchester, Council Leader Sarah Mitchell watches with growing concern as her team struggles to process building permits with half the staff they had five years ago. ""We're expected to solve the housing crisis with both hands tied behind our backs,"" she remarks as she reviews plans for a stalled affordable housing project.

* Oliver Letwin, the government's market-oriented ideologue, has become the unlikely face of housing policy reform. However, his theoretical approaches clash with the practical realities faced by local councillors like Tom Jenkins in Bristol, who spends his evenings mediating heated town halls where residents oppose new developments near their cherished dog-walking paths. ""Housing isn't just about economics,"" Jenkins sighs, ""it's about communities, about compromise.""

* As public services become increasingly threadbare, the human cost becomes evident in places like Eastwood, where the local library now opens just two days a week and the community center has closed entirely. Housing officer Priya Sharma notes the irony: ""They want us to process more applications, consult more with communities, and police unscrupulous developers, all while our budgets are cut year after year. Something has to give.""

* The disconnect between central government policy and local needs becomes apparent in the brownfield redevelopment project in Liverpool, where promising plans for 200 affordable homes have stalled due to lack of funding for essential infrastructure. Local businessman and community advocate James Wilson observes, ""This budget talks about encouraging development but takes away the very tools councils need to make it happen. It's like ordering someone to build a house but refusing to give them any materials.""

SECTION 3

The government's approach to housing policy reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how communities function and develop. By failing to financially support local governments while simultaneously expecting them to solve the housing crisis, the budget creates a paradox that cannot be resolved through market ideology alone. As councils struggle with diminished resources and growing demands, the question remains whether this ""bankrupt budget"" will lead to the social mayhem that many predict, or if a more coherent approach to housing and public services will emerge from the crisis. Any other questions?""","""SECTION 1
In a city where public trust in government had waned, residents began to whisper about the legacy of a budget described as bankrupt—not merely in sums, but in lost ideas and unfulfilled promises. The local council, once a beacon of hope for community development, now struggled under the weight of a policy framework that ignored the very streets and people it was meant to serve.

SECTION 2
Amid dim prospects and a faltering economy, community leaders convened in a town hall meeting to confront the reality of diminished public services and broken housing initiatives. The meeting laid out a roadmap for revival that, while modest, sparked cautious optimism across the neighborhood. Key challenges were identified:
* The draining public expenditure threatened essential services and community safety.
* Housing development stalled as local councils lacked both funds and authority to enforce effective change.
* A misguided faith in free-market policies clashed with the foundational needs of urban planning and community integration.
* Public sentiment increasingly demanded a reawakening of genuine governmental stewardship and local empowerment.

SECTION 3
In the wake of these revelations, grassroots movements began mobilizing to restore the dignity of local governance. The story of the struggling budget transformed into a rallying cry for inclusive planning and prudent fiscal management. Community efforts, though still in their infancy, promised that new ideas and active local government could one day replace the remnants of a failed era. Any other questions?""","""SECTION 1

The headline screamed from the discarded newspaper swirling in the London wind: ""Bankrupt Budget!"" Inside, the op-ed piece, penned by a seasoned political commentator, dissected the Chancellor's latest fiscal offering with brutal efficiency. It wasn't just the numbers – though the author questioned how much more public services could endure – it was the sheer intellectual void, the lack of vision, the abject failure to grasp the realities gnawing at the foundations of British society. Housing, the article argued, was a prime example of this ideological bankruptcy. The small tweaks and fanfare couldn't mask the fundamental disconnect: a thriving housing sector needed empowered, well-funded local governments.

* A local council member wearily sighed as they read the news.

SECTION 2

The budget proposed further cuts to local council budgets. Council Leader, Sarah Jenkins knew this meant impossible choices. Libraries were already operating on skeleton staff, bin collections were erratic, and social care was stretched beyond breaking point. The article’s point about housing hit home hard. New developments were stalled, not due to lack of demand, but due to the Council’s inability to process applications efficiently, to address community concerns, or to effectively police developers who cut corners.

* It was only a matter of time before something catastrophic happens.
* The news painted a bleak picture for the future of local government.

SECTION 3

Oliver Letwin's faith in the free market to magically solve the housing crisis seemed dangerously naive. Without strong, locally-led interventions, the market would continue to favour profit over people, creating sprawling, soulless developments that alienated communities and exacerbated existing inequalities. Sarah knew that to build places where people wanted to live, you needed councillors listening to residents, engaging with their concerns, and championing their interests. You needed financially sound local authorities capable of planning, investing, and enforcing standards. The budget, it seemed, offered the exact opposite.

* Council leader Sarah vowed to fight the cuts, not just for the sake of the council, but for the sake of the communities.
* It was the last straw.

 After found footage and phone footage films, here, with the inevitability of a man in belted jeans launching a new iPhone model to a crowd of saucer-eyed disciples, is the first ever selfie movie – a naive and self-indulgent piece with very little going for it other than zeitgeist bragging rights. Shot mostly on camera phones by the actors, #Starvecrow is a tiny-budget British drama about a group of insufferably privileged twentysomething mates. Ben Willens is Ben, a controlling narcissist who creepily films everything on his phone. When his on-off girlfriend (Ashlie Walker) walks out for good, he steals her friends’ mobiles – giving the film its footage of attention-seeking drunken antics and nastier behaviour never intended for Snapchat. Ben, like one of the lads from Made in Chelsea after inadvertently catching an episode of The Moral Maze on Radio 4, tells his psychotherapist that he wants to see “between the cracks” of people’s lives. The whole thing is an endurance test of amateurish improv and muddled plotting, with some pseudo-arty cutaways thrown in. No doubt the film-makers are sincere in wanting to say something about the digital age, toxic masculinity and the harmful impact of hypersexualising young women.

 What’s going for it? I’m a sucker for a bit of Romanesque architecture. Even the prospect of a half-ruined tower and a crumbled jamb is enough to drag me several score miles off my beaten track.

I found myself driving with boundless enthusiasm toward Kelso, lured by whispers of Romanesque treasures. My car seemed to run on my excitement alone as I navigated the winding Scottish roads.

The border town appeared like a ship emerging from morning mist, anchored where the Tweed and Teviot rivers converge in gentle greeting. I parked near the Square, immediately captivated by the town hall's magnificent columns standing proudly over ancient cobblestones.

But it was the abbey that had drawn me here—a magnificent scheme of 12th-century architecture now reduced to evocative fragments. I walked slowly through the ruins, imagining the potential these walls once held when Kelso Abbey was the region's mightiest monastery. Though diminished, its remaining stones still commanded reverence, telling stories of power, faith, and time's relentless march.

After exploring the abbey grounds, I wandered through Kelso's streets, each one an architectural delight as promised. Historic buildings leaned toward each other across narrow passages, their facades displaying centuries of craftsmanship and care.

By late afternoon, I found myself at a small café overlooking the river junction. An elderly local noticed my guidebook and smiled.

""First time in Kelso?"" he asked.

When I nodded, he launched into tales of border raids, royal visits, and architectural triumphs that no guidebook contained. He spoke of how the town had persevered through centuries, its character shaped by the very rivers that embraced it.

As sunset painted the abbey ruins in golden light, I realized Kelso had cast its spell on me. Like countless travelers before, I had come for the Romanesque architecture but would leave enchanted by the town's complete, living story—a place where past and present flowed together as naturally as its two beloved rivers.

Any other questions?","Kelso became more than a destination—it was an adventure in history and architecture. I arrived with a quiet enthusiasm, drawn by the promise of Romanesque charms and the crumbling remains of its once-majestic abbey. The half-ruined tower and the crumbled jamb told tales of bygone eras, whispering secrets that ignited my imagination.

Wandering the cobbled streets, I discovered that every corner of Kelso was crafted with potential. The town hall, with its grand columns leaping over the Square, stood as a testament to ambitious schemes of its past. There was even a local legend about an ingenious blueprint—a scheme that, had it run its course, would have transformed Kelso into a cultural ship sailing on a sea of art and history.

In quiet moments beneath the shadowed arches of the abbey ruins, I mused over a plan of my own. I envisioned a run of preservation efforts led by the community, one where each resident—the local historians, architects, and enthusiastic citizens—would band together to restore the subtle grandeur of Kelso’s monuments. My mind filled with ideas of interactive tours and creative installations that would allow visitors to experience architecture as a living, breathing narrative.

As dusk fell over Kelso, the landscape turned into a canvas of memories and possibilities, each stone a silent storyteller of past glory and untapped potential. The town, squished neatly between the banks of the Tweed and Teviot, had unraveled its timeless elegance to greet a visitor not merely as history, but as a dynamic promise of what could be—a ship ready to set sail on the currents of renewal.

Any other questions?","My enthusiasm for Romanesque architecture knows no bounds. A crumbling jamb? A half-ruined tower? Consider me gone, happily diverted miles from my planned route. This time, my architectural siren song led me to Kelso.

Like its border town brethren, Kelso's abbey is a ghost of its former self. Once the region's wealthiest monastery, only fragments remain. Yet, those fragments still hold sway, defining the town despite modern competition. Kelso itself is a delight, nestled where the Tweed and Teviot rivers meet. The town hall's grand columns dominate the cobbled square.

There’s a certain potential here, a feeling that Kelso is ready for something new. I overheard whispers of a local scheme to revitalize the riverfront, perhaps even incorporating a replica of an old trading ship as a tourist attraction. People were preparing to run a marathon to raise funds. The energy was infectious. Even in its fragmented state, Kelso possesses an undeniable charm and a resilient spirit. Its architectural bones provide a solid foundation for a vibrant future.

 The Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky has died aged 55. The news was announced on his Facebook page: “On behalf of the Hvorostovsky family, it is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Dmitri Hvorostovsky – beloved operatic baritone, husband, father, son, and friend – at age 55. After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, November 22, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us.” Hvorostovsky was born in a tough industrial city in Siberia, telling an interviewer in 2002 that as a high school student, prison looked a more likely destination than the opera stage, with “drinking, drugs and fighting,” part of his adolescence. A teenage obsession with pop music also almost claimed the singer for a different world, and his hard drinking and wild behaviour continued into his 20s and early 30s. He came to international attention in 1989 when he beat Bryn Terfel to win the Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his prematurely white hair, dashing good looks and powerful stage presence, his heartthrob image was carefully cultivated and he amassed legions of fans. A career performing in all the major opera houses and concert halls followed, and he was hailed one of the world’s greatest baritones for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice.

Dmitri Hvorostovsky's path from the harsh streets of Siberia to the world's grandest opera houses reads like a libretto itself. Born in an industrial Siberian city, young Dmitri seemed destined for trouble rather than stardom. As he once confessed in a 2002 interview, prison appeared a more likely destination than the opera stage during his youth, with ""drinking, drugs and fighting"" dominating his adolescence. His teenage obsession with pop music nearly pulled him away from classical training altogether, and the wild behavior continued well into his twenties and thirties, creating the foundation for a life as dramatic as the roles he would later embody.

***

The turning point came in 1989 when Hvorostovsky stunned the classical music world by defeating Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel to claim the prestigious Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his striking prematurely white hair, commanding good looks, and magnetic stage presence, he quickly became opera's heartthrob. This carefully cultivated image gathered him devoted followers worldwide, but it was the extraordinary quality of his voice—rich, fluid, and profoundly expressive—that cemented his reputation as one of the world's greatest baritones.

***

His international acclaim opened doors for Hvorostovsky to become an ambassador for Russian musical culture. He introduced western audiences to the neglected treasures of Russian song repertoire, performing alongside the remarkable accompanist Ivari Ilja. In the opera world, his Verdi interpretations were particularly celebrated, though perhaps his most defining role was Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin—a complex antihero whom Hvorostovsky transformed through his charismatic and provocative performances. His interpretation of Onegin became so definitive that critics and audiences alike considered the role inseparable from the man.

***

Tragically, Hvorostovsky's brilliant career was cut short by brain cancer, against which he fought valiantly for two and a half years. On November 22, surrounded by family in his London home, the great baritone took his final bow at age 55. The announcement on his Facebook page spoke of ""the warmth of his voice and his spirit"" remaining with us always—a fitting epitaph for an artist who rose from the unlikeliest of beginnings to touch millions with his extraordinary gift. From Siberian troublemaker to operatic legend, Hvorostovsky's life journey reminds us that transformation is possible through passion and talent, even as his untimely passing leaves the world of music in mourning. Is there anything else I can help with?","In the wake of tragic news, the world mourns the loss of a beloved talent whose resonant voice once filled concert halls and opera houses with unmatched passion. Dmitri, a man who fought a grueling two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, passed away peacefully, surrounded by his loved ones, leaving behind a legacy that continues to captivate hearts around the globe.

***
Born in a rugged Siberian city, Dmitri's early years were marked by hardship and rebellion. His youthful days were rife with danger, and the allure of an unruly life threatened to sweep him away from music. Yet, amidst the challenges of a tumultuous adolescence filled with drinking, drugs, and brawls, the seeds of a future greatness were quietly sown.

***
A life-altering moment came in 1989 when he stunned the world by defeating celebrated competitors to win the Cardiff Singer of the World competition. With his striking appearance and the prematurely white hair that became his trademark, Dmitri cultivated a heartthrob image that made him a global sensation. The rich, expressive fluidity of his voice, combined with his compelling stage presence, led him to be celebrated in the most prestigious opera houses and concert halls across the globe.

***
Beyond his stage triumphs, Dmitri was devoted to reviving the neglected Russian song repertoire, bringing it to the ears of western audiences with the help of exceptional collaborators. His memorable portrayals, especially his charismatic and provocative interpretation of Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin, left an indelible mark on opera. As the memory of his powerful performances lingers on, his enduring spirit and the warmth of his voice continue to inspire music lovers everywhere.

After a valiant two-and-a-half-year fight against brain cancer, Hvorostovsky passed away peacefully on the morning of November 22, surrounded by loved ones near his London home. The statement concluded with a poignant wish that the warmth of his voice and spirit would forever remain with those who knew and admired him.

Born in a rugged Siberian industrial city, Hvorostovsky's early life seemed destined for a different path. He confessed in a 2002 interview that as a high school student, a life behind bars seemed more likely than gracing the opera stage, with youthful indiscretions involving ""drinking, drugs and fighting"" marking his adolescence. Even a teenage fascination with pop music threatened to pull him away from his eventual operatic calling. His wild streak continued well into his twenties and early thirties, a period of intense partying and unpredictable behavior that belied the discipline and artistry he would later embrace.

***

Hvorostovsky's rise to international stardom began in 1989 when he triumphed over Bryn Terfel to win the prestigious Cardiff Singer of the World competition. He possessed a captivating stage presence, enhanced by his prematurely white hair and striking good looks. This image was consciously developed, attracting a devoted following that transcended the traditional opera audience. His talent opened doors to the world's leading opera houses and concert halls, where he garnered widespread acclaim as one of the greatest baritones of his generation, lauded for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice.

His fame allowed him to champion the neglected and often unknown Russian song repertoire, introducing it to Western audiences with the invaluable support of his accompanist, Ivari Ilja.

* **Brexit Planning and First-Time Homebuyers:** Philip Hammond has allocated £3bn for Brexit preparations over the next two years, adding to the £700m already spent. Meanwhile, first-time homebuyers received significant relief with the abolition of stamp duty on properties up to £300,000, benefiting 80% of new buyers. Those purchasing homes between £300,000 and £500,000 will save £5,000 in stamp duty. The controversial help-to-buy scheme also received a £10bn extension until 2021, despite concerns that it contributes to rising house prices.

* **Youth Benefits in Transportation:** Young people received good news in the budget with the extension of the young persons railcard. Previously available only to those under 27, the new ""millennial card"" will extend the 30% rail fare discount to those under 31. Further details about implementation will be announced following negotiations with rail companies, potentially easing transportation costs for millions of young commuters across the UK.","* In a sweeping move, Brexit planners led by Philip Hammond have earmarked an extra £3bn (on top of the already spent £700m) for Brexit preparations over the next two years, while the budget rolls out one of its biggest giveaways yet by abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers on properties up to £300,000—savings that affect 80% of these buyers—and offering a further £5,000 cut for those spending between £300,000 and £500,000. The extension of the help-to-buy scheme (with an extra £10bn committed until 2021) adds to the transformative measures aimed at addressing the country’s housing and economic challenges amid post-Brexit adjustments.

* On the transport front, changes are on the horizon for young commuters as the government proposes extending the railcard discount—originally reserved for under-27s—to now include those under 31, potentially boosting mobility and affordability for a broader segment of young adults. The full details of this “millennial card” and subsequent arrangements will be finalised after further negotiations with rail companies, marking another significant initiative in the government's revised budget strategy.","The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, stood before Parliament, a glint in his eye. He was ready to deliver a budget that would, he hoped, silence the critics and usher in a new era of prosperity, or at least, navigate the choppy waters of Brexit.

""We must be prepared,"" he declared, announcing an additional £3 billion earmarked for Brexit preparations, building on the £700 million already committed. This, he assured, would ensure a smooth transition, though details remained tucked away in supplementary estimates, waiting to be revealed like cards in a slow-motion poker game.

The biggest applause, however, came with the announcement of a significant giveaway aimed at first-time homebuyers. A collective sigh of relief (and perhaps a hurried calculation of potential savings) swept through the chamber as Hammond declared the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers on properties up to £300,000. ""This represents a cut for 80% of first-time buyers!"" he proclaimed, ""And those spending between £300,000 and £500,000 will save £5,000!""

But the sweetener came with a bitter aftertaste for some. The controversial help-to-buy scheme, criticized for inflating house prices, received a further boost of £10 billion, extending its life to 2021. Whispers of ""ballooning house prices"" could be heard among the opposition benches.

Finally, a nod to the younger generation. The young persons railcard, currently enjoyed by those under 27, would be extended to those under 31. The ""millennial card,"" as it was becoming known, would continue to offer a 30% discount, subject to successful negotiations with rail companies. The Chancellor sat down, hoping he had done enough. The real test, however, would come in the days and weeks ahead, as the budget was dissected and debated.

Here are the key take aways:
*   Brexit preparations received a significant financial boost, signifying the government's commitment to planning for various scenarios.
*   First-time homebuyers were the biggest winners with the abolition of stamp duty, although the extension of the help-to-buy scheme raised concerns about its impact on house prices.

 Humphrey Bogart’s world-weariness and romanticism take on something brutal and misogynist in this 1950 noir masterpiece directed by Nicholas Ray – and it’s a marvellous performance by Gloria Grahame. This national rerelease is linked to the Grahame retrospective at BFI Southbank, in London. It is adapted from the hardboiled thriller by Dorothy B Hughes, changing her story and rehabilitating the male lead in one way, but in another, introducing a new strain of pessimism and defeat. Bogart is Dixon Steele, a boozy, depressive Hollywood screenwriter whose tendency to violence and self-hatred isn’t helped by the fact that he hasn’t had a hit in years. Like the directors, producers and actors he occasionally sees in bars, his best days were before the second world war. One night at a restaurant, his agent offers him a much-needed gig adapting some brainless bestseller and Dix shruggingly accepts. The wide-eyed hatcheck girl, Mildred (Martha Stewart), tells him she loves the book and, amused, Dix invites her back to his place to tell him what it’s all about. Having established his intentions are gentlemanly, Mildred agrees. Whatever Dix’s intentions may actually have been, they are blown out of the water when the pair of them run into his new neighbour as he is about to show Mildred across the threshold – on her way back to her own apartment. This is Laurel (Grahame), who is wryly amused by what she clearly sees as Dix’s clumsy, predatory designs on this poor girl.

The dimly lit restaurant buzzed with hushed conversations as Dixon Steele nursed his drink, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of disdain and disinterest. Years of Hollywood disappointments had etched permanent lines of cynicism on his face, matching the world-weariness that seemed to permeate his very being. When his agent approached with news of a potential job adapting a bestseller, Dix couldn't muster much enthusiasm. The evening took an unexpected turn when the hatcheck girl, Mildred, gushed about her love for the book in question. Perhaps it was her youthful enthusiasm or maybe just loneliness, but Dix invited her back to his place, insisting his intentions were honorable. As they approached his apartment, they encountered his new neighbor Laurel, whose knowing smile suggested she saw right through him.

Truck horns blared in the distance as Dix recounted the evening's events to the police detective. Mildred had been found murdered, and his was the last face she'd been seen with. The detective's questions grew increasingly pointed as Dix maintained his innocence with a volatile mixture of indignation and barely contained rage. His violent outbursts during questioning did him no favors, confirming the detective's suspicions about his character. Only Laurel provided an alibi, claiming she'd seen Mildred leave Dix's apartment alone. As the investigation continued, Dix and Laurel grew closer, finding in each other a kindred damaged spirit, their romance blooming against the backdrop of murder and suspicion.

The precarious nature of their relationship became evident as Dix's volatile temperament surfaced in moments of jealousy and paranoia. Laurel found herself both drawn to and frightened by the man she was falling in love with. Each time his anger flared, doubt crept into her mind - could he have killed Mildred after all? The police continued to circle, presenting new evidence that pointed to Dix's guilt. His history of bar fights and violent confrontations painted a damning picture. As pressure mounted, Laurel's faith began to waver, and Dix could see it in her eyes - the same look everyone gave him, a mixture of fear and judgment.

In the shadowy world they inhabited, truth and perception blurred into an indistinguishable haze. Dix's reputation preceded him at every turn, coloring how others interpreted his actions. The Hollywood that had once embraced him now watched with morbid fascination as he spiraled downward. Laurel stood at a crossroads, torn between her heart and her instinct for self-preservation. Their love story, like Dix's screenplays, seemed destined for tragedy - a noir tale where even innocence couldn't guarantee redemption. As the investigation reached its climax, both Dix and Laurel would learn that sometimes the most dangerous place isn't in the company of a potential killer, but in the lonely place where doubt destroys love.","Humphrey Bogart’s hardened gaze and reflective musings set the tone for a noir narrative steeped in brutality and the lingering shadows of old Hollywood. Dixon Steele, the aging screenwriter whose career has dwindled to a series of half-forgotten scripts and bitter regrets, navigates a world where masculine posturing and fragile romance collide. His recent assignment—adapting a popular bestseller into another forgettable film—offers a brief respite from his melancholic reality, even if only to relive the days when danger, love, and ambition still sparked life into every cliché-laden encounter.

Truck rattled along the rain-soaked streets as Dix made his way back from a last call at a dim dive bar, the vehicle as battered and weary as its owner. The rumble of the engine was a constant reminder of the relentless march of time and the heavy burdens he carried—a life of faded glories and self-destructive indulgences. Despite the promise of a fresh script and a fleeting chance at redemption, the sound of that clattering truck echoed the grim undertones of his existence, a counterpoint to the temporary warmth found in fleeting, if misguided, connections.

At a bustling restaurant where fate seemed ready to change the script of his life, the unassuming Mildred—a young hatcheck girl with laughter and hope quickly falling prey to cynicism—admits her admiration for the original story. Amused and almost tender, Dix invites her to his apartment, intending to share the intricate web of narratives that once defined his best work. Yet, just as sincerity begins to peek through his jaded façade, a chance encounter with Laurel, the perceptive new neighbor, shatters the illusion of innocent flirtation. With a knowing smirk, she unveils the predatory patterns hidden behind Dix’s gentlemanly overtures, exposing the darker side of his nature.

In the echoes of lost dreams and sleepless nights, the story unfolds as a bittersweet commentary on the depravity and decay of a once-glorious past. As Laurel’s keen observations force him to confront his own failings and as Mildred’s hopeful whispers dissolve into the smoky corridors of his apartment, Dixon Steele is left to reckon with the realization that his best days are irrevocably behind him. In this labyrinth of self-destruction and regret, each character—whether a fleeting muse or a penetrating critic—mirrors the brutal realities of an era where passion, violence, and disillusionment dance in a dizzying, unending nocturne.","Humphrey Bogart's world-weariness and romanticism morph into something brutal and misogynistic in this 1950 noir masterpiece, a film brilliantly directed by Nicholas Ray, showcasing a marvelous performance by Gloria Grahame. The national re-release coincides with the Grahame retrospective at BFI Southbank in London. Adapted from Dorothy B Hughes' hardboiled thriller, the film deviates from the original narrative, attempting to rehabilitate the male lead in certain aspects while simultaneously introducing a deeper sense of pessimism and defeat. Bogart embodies Dixon Steele, a boozy, depressive Hollywood screenwriter whose penchant for violence and self-loathing is exacerbated by his string of recent failures.

Truck horns blared in the distance as Dix, reminiscent of the directors, producers, and actors he encountered in dimly lit bars, felt his prime receding into the pre-war era. A much-needed opportunity arose when his agent offered him a gig to adapt a vapid bestseller, an offer Dix begrudgingly accepted. Mildred (Martha Stewart), the innocent hatcheck girl, professed her love for the book, prompting Dix, amused, to invite her to his apartment for a summary. He assured her his intentions were purely gentlemanly, and Mildred, trusting his words, agreed.

However, Dix's carefully constructed façade crumbled when they encountered his new neighbor, Laurel (Grahame), just as he was about to usher Mildred across the threshold. Laurel, with a wry amusement, witnessed Dix's clumsy, predatory advances towards the vulnerable girl. Her presence disrupted Dix's plan, revealing his true character beneath the veneer of charm and sophistication. The encounter hung heavy in the air, charged with unspoken judgments and simmering tensions.

Laurel's arrival marked a turning point, her sharp wit and perceptive gaze cutting through Dix's carefully constructed image. Mildred, sensing the undercurrents, quickly excused herself, leaving Dix to face the consequences of his actions. The scene left a lingering sense of unease, foreshadowing the unraveling of Dix's carefully constructed world and the emergence of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface.

 Philip Hammond must borrow an extra £90bn over the next five years after the Treasury’s independent forecaster downgraded productivity growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add £90.5bn to the UK’s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond’s target of balancing the government’s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be £35bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR’s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth – which measures the average output per hour worked – of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR’s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 – almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 – still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she said. “Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.” The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound.

In a sobering assessment of Britain's economic outlook, Chancellor Philip Hammond now finds himself confronted with the need to borrow an additional £90bn over the next five years following the Office for Budget Responsibility's downgrade of productivity growth projections.

The OBR's revised forecast paints a concerning picture of prolonged wage stagnation that will simultaneously reduce tax revenue and increase government borrowing requirements. This adjustment would add £90.5bn to the national debt, potentially derailing Hammond's ambition to balance the government's books by 2025.

Treasury officials have attempted to soften the blow by highlighting positive factors, including higher employment figures and better-than-anticipated borrowing over the previous year. They claim these elements reduce the net borrowing increase to £35bn, theoretically keeping the chancellor's mid-2020s surplus target within reach.

However, economic analysts have criticized the OBR for not being pessimistic enough. Some experts believe the forecaster continues to overestimate British businesses' capacity to invest in productivity-enhancing equipment and processes. Critics argue the OBR should have projected the near-zero productivity growth of the past seven years to continue through the next five.

Joanna Davies of Fathom Consulting suggested that even the OBR's downgraded productivity growth forecast of 1.1% through 2022—approximately half the 2.1% average maintained in the three decades before 2007—remains overly optimistic. Davies pointed out that actual productivity growth has averaged just 0.3% over the past five years.

The combination of productivity challenges and demographic pressures from an aging population led Davies to estimate that the UK's true economic growth potential likely falls between 0.5% and 1%, significantly below the OBR's 1.5% assumption.

Robert Chote, who chairs the OBR, acknowledged additional headwinds beyond productivity issues, noting that Britain's export sector would likely underperform expectations despite the competitive advantage a weaker pound should theoretically provide.

This recalibration of economic expectations signals difficult choices ahead for government spending, taxation, and public services as the UK navigates these fiscal constraints.

P.P.S. This summary presents the key economic challenges the UK government faces according to the original article, maintaining the core narrative about productivity concerns, borrowing projections, and differing economic outlooks between official forecasts and independent analysts.","In a bold forecast that has stirred considerable debate, the UK Chancellor finds himself grappling with the need to secure an additional £90bn over the upcoming five years, a consequence of revised low productivity growth expectations. The government’s fiscal outlook has come under scrutiny as the Treasury’s independent forecaster painted a picture of prolonged subdued performance in the average output per hour worked. Critics have warned that stunted business investment in new technologies and processes may continue to hamper the nation's broader economic prospects.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has issued a cautionary update, noting that weaker-than-anticipated wage increases in the coming period will likely result in lower tax receipts. While the Treasury presented a more optimistic summary, highlighting recent gains in employment and improved borrowing circumstances that would lessen the net borrowing rise to £35bn, there remains a significant burden that threatens long-term fiscal objectives. The forecast, which predicts a modest 1.1% increase in productivity until 2022, is seen by some economists as overly hopeful compared to the sustained near-zero gains experienced over the previous seven years.

Joanna Davies, a reputable economist with Fathom Consulting, expressed her concerns regarding the OBR’s projections. She contended that when factoring in demographic changes—namely, an increasingly aged population—the potential for overall economic growth diminishes markedly, potentially settling within a narrow band of 0.5% to 1%. This outlook diverges sharply from the more robust figures previously envisaged by the forecasters, drawing attention to the broader structural challenges that British industries face.

There is also rising apprehension about the export sector’s performance. The OBR chair, Robert Chote, remarked that the anticipated benefits of a weaker national currency might not materialize as expected if the export sector fails to become a significant engine for improvement. This sentiment underlines a growing consensus among analysts that the current framework overestimates the capacity of local businesses to adapt and innovate.

As the government moves forward amid these contentious forecasts, political and economic stakeholders will be closely monitoring the unfolding fiscal scenario. The unfolding narrative poses serious questions about the long-term sustainability of public finances while highlighting the intricate balance between addressing immediate borrowing needs and fostering an environment conducive to robust economic growth.

P.P.S. The discussion surrounding these projections remains open-ended, inviting further analysis from various experts in the field.","The weight of the numbers pressed down on Philip Hammond's shoulders. Ninety billion pounds. That’s what the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was saying he’d need to borrow – an additional £90 billion over the next five years. The OBR’s bleak forecast painted a picture of stagnant wages, diminished tax revenue, and a swelling national debt. His target of balancing the government’s books by 2025 seemed to be slipping away, obscured by the gathering clouds of economic uncertainty.

The Treasury attempted to spin a more positive narrative. They pointed to increased employment and better-than-expected borrowing in the past year, suggesting that the actual net borrowing increase would be closer to £35 billion. This, they argued, still kept the surplus target within reach.

However, the OBR's report faced strong criticism for not being pessimistic *enough*. Many analysts believed that the OBR was still overestimating the capacity of British businesses to invest and innovate, the linchpin for productivity gains. They argued that the anemic productivity growth of the past seven years – hovering near zero – was likely to persist.

Joanna Davies, an economist at Fathom Consulting, added her voice to the chorus of skepticism. She called the OBR's forecast of 1.1% productivity growth until 2022 ""ambitious,"" especially compared to the 2.1% average seen in the decades leading up to 2007. Davies predicted that lower productivity, coupled with a rapidly aging population, would severely hamper overall GDP growth. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she stated. ""Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.”

Even the OBR chair, Robert Chote, conceded that GDP growth would be hampered not only by lower productivity, but also by a weak export sector failing to capitalize on the weaker pound.

The implications were clear. Austerity, it seemed, was here to stay. Difficult choices lay ahead. Hammond looked out of his window at the gray London sky, the weight of the nation's financial future pressing heavily on him.

P.P.S. The figures presented a somber outlook for the UK's financial future.

 MPs have been forced to deny that a Commons vote last week means animals are not recognised in the UK as sentient life forms. An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as “weird and dishonest”, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards – not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.” Theresa May said at Wednesday’s PMQs: “We recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.” Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: “I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.” Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: “It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government’s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.” However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.

  ""story"": ""# The Great Animal Sentience Debate\n\nA political storm was brewing in Westminster. What had started as a seemingly routine parliamentary vote on the European Union withdrawal bill had morphed into a full-blown controversy about whether the UK government believed animals could feel pain and emotion.\n\nIt began when an amendment to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on November 15th. Almost immediately, social media erupted with accusations that Conservative MPs had voted against recognizing animals as sentient beings.\n\n\""I woke up to thousands of angry messages,\"" said Zac Goldsmith, a Conservative MP known for his environmental advocacy. \""People were saying I believed animals couldn't feel pain. It was bizarre and completely untrue.\""\n\nGoldsmith had spent the morning trying to contain the damage, tweeting clarifications that the vote had been about legal procedure, not the principle of whether animals could feel. His colleague Rachel Maclean had even recorded a video explaining the situation, labeling the mischaracterizations as \""fake news.\""\n\nMeanwhile, at 10 Downing Street, Prime Minister Theresa May was preparing to address the issue at PMQs, knowing it would undoubtedly come up. Her advisors had prepared a clear statement: \""We recognize and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.\""\n\nMichael Gove, the Environment Secretary, had been bombarded with letters from concerned citizens and MPs alike. He had written to MP Hugo Swire explaining the government's position, which Swire promptly shared online with the addendum: \""I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.\""\n\nBut the clarifications seemed to be drowning in a sea of outrage. Sue Perkins, the beloved television presenter, had condemned MPs on Twitter, her message being shared thousands of times. Multiple petitions were circulating online, directed at the House of Lords, Parliament, and Gove personally.\n\nCaroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party and one of the amendment's proposers, was both frustrated and vindicated by the controversy. During the debate, she had reminded the House that the animal sentience clause had originally been championed by the UK during its 1997 EU presidency.\n\n\""This isn't some EU imposition,\"" she told journalists gathered outside Parliament. \""We helped create this protection. And now, ironically, Brexit threatens to undo our own good work.\""\n\nThe British Veterinary Association had added fuel to the fire with its senior vice-president, Gudrun Ravetz, expressing extreme concern that MPs had voted down what she called a \""seminal clause.\""\n\nYet Conservative MP Henry Smith offered a different perspective, pointing out that despite the EU's recognition of animal sentience, many practices across Europe that animal rights groups opposed remained legal.\n\nAs government officials scrambled to clarify their position and animal rights activists continued to mobilize, one thing became clear: what might have seemed like a technical legal matter had touched a nerve with the British public. The question of how Brexit would affect the UK's standards on animal welfare had moved from the margins to the mainstream of political debate.\n\nIn the corridors of Westminster, MPs from all parties were now asking: How had a procedural vote on legal terminology become a referendum on whether animals could feel pain? And more importantly, how would the government ensure that the UK's departure from the EU wouldn't lead to any regression in animal protection?""

  ""content"": ""In a turbulent debate that has captured public attention, MPs have been forced to clarify that a recent Commons vote did not signal a rejection of animal sentience in the UK. The vote in question, concerning an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, was narrowly defeated by a margin of 313 to 295 votes, triggering a flurry of media speculation and heated political discourse.\n\nThe amendment, which sought to enshrine the principles of animal sentience in UK law by incorporating key aspects of the Lisbon Treaty, quickly became a lightning rod for controversy. Critics argued that the defeat of the amendment could be seen as diminishing the longstanding commitment to animal welfare that the UK has championed since its pivotal role in establishing the EU protocol on animal sentience.\n\nTory MP Zac Goldsmith was among those who stepped forward to set the record straight, emphasizing that the vote was strictly about the correct legal procedures required to ensure animal welfare standards. 'This was not a vote on whether animals are sentient,' he stated in a series of tweets. His fellow Conservative MP Rachel Maclean echoed this sentiment in a video statement, referring to misleading reports as 'fake news' while underlining that the commitment to protect animals had never wavered.\n\nProminent voices across the political spectrum have reiterated the UK government's dedication to treating animals as sentient beings. Former Prime Minister Theresa May reaffirmed this commitment during PMQs, while Environment Secretary Michael Gove’s correspondence, widely shared by Tory MP Hugo Swire, underscored the belief held by MPs that there is no question regarding animals’ capacity to feel.\n\nNevertheless, the controversy has spurred protests from animal rights groups and lobbied intensified online, with petitions circulating among the House of Lords, in parliament, and directly to government officials. Public figures like Sue Perkins and experts from the British Veterinary Association have voiced strong concerns that, at a time when the UK is keen to uphold high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit, any perceived de-escalation of these principles is problematic.\n\nThe debate took an interesting turn when Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas invoked the UK's historical role in championing animal sentience. Citing the origins of this clause during the 1997 UK presidency of the EU, and its subsequent reinforcement in EU law from 1999 onwards, Lucas reminded her colleagues and the public that the recognition of animals as sentient forms the cornerstone of progressive animal welfare policy.\n\nDespite assurances from several MPs and the government’s commitment to uphold animal welfare, the controversy has ignited a broader conversation about legislative transparency and the safeguarding of animal rights. As discussions continue in both public forums and behind closed doors in parliament, the debate serves as a stark reminder of the complexities involved in balancing procedural legality with the ethical imperatives of modern governance.""

The seasonal treat-based countdown might these days have expanded into cosmetics and booze, but nothing beats 24 days of chocolate. Every December, as frost patterns windowpanes and holiday lights twinkle from eaves, families across the globe partake in the time-honored tradition of the advent calendar. While luxury brands now offer everything from tiny bottles of gin to miniature lipsticks behind those numbered doors, it's the simple joy of daily chocolate that continues to capture hearts and taste buds alike.

***

Sarah Henderson discovered this truth last year when her well-meaning husband splurged on a premium beauty advent calendar for her instead of her usual chocolate one. ""Each day I'd open a tiny serum or face mask sample, and all I could think about was chocolate,"" she laughs. By December 12th, she'd secretly purchased a traditional chocolate calendar to enjoy alongside her beauty products. ""The kids thought it was hilarious that mum was sneaking chocolate before breakfast,"" she recalls. ""But there's something about that little moment of sweetness that just makes the countdown to Christmas feel right.""

***

The history of advent calendars dates back to 19th century Germany, where families would mark the days until Christmas by drawing chalk lines or lighting candles. The first commercial advent calendar was produced in the early 1900s, but it wasn't until the 1950s that chocolate versions began to appear. Today, the market for these festive countdowns has exploded into a multi-million-pound industry, with options ranging from artisanal single-origin chocolate collections costing upwards of £50 to simple supermarket varieties for less than a fiver.

***

Psychologists suggest there's science behind our preference for chocolate advent calendars. ""The combination of routine, anticipation, and reward creates a powerful daily ritual,"" explains Dr. Jennifer Morton, a consumer psychologist. ""Chocolate triggers the release of endorphins and serotonin – our feel-good hormones – making it the perfect small daily pleasure during what can be a stressful season."" This might explain why even adults who don't typically indulge in sweets find themselves eagerly opening those little cardboard doors throughout December.

***

As retailers continue to innovate with alternative advent calendars – from cheese selections to craft beer, scented candles to socks – chocolate calendars remain the bestsellers year after year. Perhaps it's nostalgia, perhaps it's the simple pleasure of that moment of indulgence, or perhaps it's just that chocolate, with its universal appeal, makes the perfect companion for the countdown to Christmas. Whatever the reason, as we approach another holiday season, thousands of shoppers will reach for that familiar rectangular box, knowing that behind each numbered door awaits a small but perfect moment of joy.","The seasonal countdown, once centered solely on a daily dose of delicious chocolate, has recently evolved into a delightful smorgasbord of treats. Retailers and creators alike have embraced the festive spirit by offering consumers an array of indulgent options ranging from artisanal chocolates to luxurious cosmetics and even bespoke cocktails. This evolution reflects changing tastes and the modern desire to blend tradition with innovation during the holiday season.

***
While the classic 24-day chocolate countdown remains a favorite, the introduction of other products such as skincare sets and curated spirits signals a broader celebration of the season. Consumers now find that each day not only marks a step closer to the holidays but also provides an opportunity to experience something unique. The tradition has transformed into an exploration of seasonal delights that cater to various interests, all wrapped in the joyous spirit of giving and self-indulgence.

***
Local businesses have found that this expansion of the countdown concept not only boosts holiday cheer but also stimulates regional economies. Small enterprises often collaborate with local artisans to produce limited-edition products that showcase both innovation and tradition. These partnerships foster a sense of community and creativity, where every item—from a elegantly packaged lipstick to a finely crafted bottle of gin—carries a story behind its creation, enriching the consumer’s holiday experience.

***
At the heart of this seasonal transformation is consumer enthusiasm. Shoppers appreciate the versatility of the modern countdown calendar, which now serves as a platform for discovering new favorites and supporting artisanal craftsmanship. Online marketplaces have flourished as these innovative calendars circulate through social media and word of mouth, drawing attention from a global audience that values both the nostalgia of chocolate and the novelty of fresh, seasonal offerings.

***
Despite the newer entrants in the realm of holiday treats, nothing quite beats the timeless appeal of 24 days of chocolate. This enduring preference underscores the power of tradition even in the face of change. As consumers continue to balance the allure of innovative products with the warmth of well-loved traditions, the festive season remains a celebration of both the old and the new—a testament to the ever-evolving spirit of holiday indulgence.","The seasonal treat-based countdown might these days have expanded into cosmetics and booze, but nothing beats 24 days of chocolate. For Sarah, the arrival of November always signaled one thing: the annual hunt for the perfect chocolate advent calendar. Gone were the days of flimsy cardboard and vaguely cocoa-flavored squares. Now, the advent calendar aisle was a battleground of luxury brands, artisan chocolatiers, and even supermarket own-brand calendars vying for attention with promises of salted caramel truffles and dark chocolate ganaches. Sarah, a self-confessed chocoholic, relished the challenge.

***

Her quest began online, a swirling vortex of reviews, unboxing videos, and meticulously photographed chocolate squares. This year, she was torn. Should she opt for the Swiss chocolatier’s offering, boasting sustainably sourced cocoa and exotic fruit fillings? Or perhaps the local artisan bakery, with its promise of unique, hand-painted designs on each individual piece? The lure of the familiar, comforting Cadbury’s calendar was also strong, whispering promises of childhood nostalgia and guaranteed chocolate satisfaction.

Sarah knew this meant a plethora of options, potentially leading to a decision paralysis of epic proportions. She’d learned from previous years’ mistakes, carefully noting the chocolate’s cocoa percentage, whether it contained nuts (a definite no-go), and the overall aesthetic appeal of the calendar itself. After all, December was a visually pleasing month, and her advent calendar had to contribute to the festive atmosphere.

***

Finally, after much deliberation and a deep dive into customer reviews, Sarah made her choice: a small, independent chocolatier specializing in single-origin cocoa beans. The calendar featured a different bean from a different region each day, promising a global chocolate journey. The price was a little steeper than she’d originally intended, but she justified it as an investment in her mental wellbeing and a celebration of the simple pleasures in life.

***

As December 1st dawned, Sarah eagerly unwrapped the first window, her heart pounding with anticipation. A dark, glossy square sat nestled within, exuding an aroma of rich, earthy cocoa. She popped it into her mouth, and a wave of intense flavor washed over her, confirming that her quest had been successful. This was more than just a chocolate advent calendar; it was an experience, a daily dose of joy, and a perfect start to the festive season.

Section 1

Winter had descended upon Oslo like a heavy blanket, muffling the sounds of the city under layers of snow and early darkness. In his studio apartment overlooking the harbor, Kim sat cross-legged on the floor, his 12-string acoustic guitar resting in his lap. The room was bathed in the warm glow of string lights that hung from exposed beams across the ceiling—his small rebellion against the perpetual twilight of Norwegian winter.

""It's not working,"" he muttered to himself, setting down his guitar and running a hand through his already disheveled hair. For months, he had been trying to capture something elusive—a certain quality of light and rhythm that seemed to live just beyond his grasp. Something that reminded him of summers spent on his grandfather's farm near Bergen, where time stretched like warm honey and the sunlight filtered through ancient pine trees until midnight.

The next morning, Kim called Ingar, Hans, and Tony—three drummers whose distinct styles had always fascinated him. ""I need you all,"" he said simply. ""Together.""

They gathered in an old wooden church outside the city, instruments arranged in a circle like some modern ritual. ""No click track,"" Kim instructed. ""No conductor. Just listen to each other.""

What emerged over the next forty-eight hours defied conventional structure. Two extended pieces that breathed like living things—expanding, contracting, shimmering with unexpected harmonics as the drummers found their collective voice. Kim's 12-string wove through it all, sometimes leading, sometimes following, its blissed-out twang hanging in the air like mist over a fjord.

Section 2

When they finally played back what they had created, the church fell silent. Outside, snow was falling heavily, but the music seemed to emanate warmth, to glow from within.

""It's summer music,"" Tony observed quietly. ""In the dead of winter.""

Kim smiled. ""Maybe that's exactly what we need.""

They named the album ""You | Me,"" two simple words separated yet connected by a vertical line—like individuals standing side by side, distinct yet harmonious. When it was released, critics struggled to categorize it. Some heard echoes of 60s psych-folk, others pointed to the mathematical precision reminiscent of Steve Reich or the joyous explorations of Julius Eastman's Femenine.

The album found its audience slowly, organically. People wrote to Kim describing how they played it during long drives across vast landscapes, how it seemed to both ground their nerves and elevate their spirits. A woman in Arizona described watching the sun set over desert canyons while side B played, and how the music seemed to make the colors more vivid, the moment more present.

As spring finally began to soften the edges of Oslo, Kim sat by his window watching ice break up in the harbor. He realized that the album, created in darkness, had somehow captured light—not just summer light, but something more essential. The light that remains even when externally everything appears dark. Music that reminds us that seasons change, that warmth returns, that beauty persists.

P.S. This story is entirely fictional and based on the provided sentences from what appears to be a music review of Norwegian composer Kim Myhr's album ""You | Me."" While Kim Myhr is a real experimental guitarist and composer, the narrative details about his creative process and personal life are invented for the purposes of this creative exercise.","Section 1
On a crisp autumn evening in a small coastal town, Nora stumbled upon a curious vinyl record hidden in the dusty corner of an old music shop. The album, with its evocative title ""You | Me,"" was by Kim Myhr—a Norwegian composer known for his experimental guitar and enchanting electronics. The shop’s owner, an elderly gentleman with a spark in his eyes, told her it was an album that defied the seasons, offering feelings as timeless as nature itself. As Nora listened, the slow-morphing rhythms and sun-dappled textures washed over her like the gentle glow of a sunset. The 12-string acoustic guitar’s loose, blissed-out twang blended with mellow electronics, carrying her into a dream-like state reminiscent of a 60s psych-folk journey. With each looping track and shifting rhythm, it was as if the music was mapping out an inner landscape—a vast expanse where every note echoed like the sweeping vistas of a forgotten highway.

Section 2
Inspired and invigorated, Nora embarked on her own little journey along the rugged coastline, the album playing softly in her car as a traveling companion. The long, continuous tracks created a roadmap for her contemplative wander, much like the roving thrum of early minimalist masters echoed through her surroundings. Just as the album welcomed the gentle interplay of three drummers, Nora found herself surrounded by the rhythms of crashing waves, rustling trees, and the murmurs of wind. Each beat and ambient shimmer offered both commentary and momentum, grounding her as she delved deeper into lost thoughts and future dreams. The landscape seemed to mirror the album's tranquil momentum—vast and serene—while her heart, filled with cautious hope, drifted into a state of gentle reverie. It was a journey that reminded her that sometimes the most profound travels were those that led her within.

P.S. Remember that every journey begins with a single, unexpected note—a reminder to embrace the rhythms of life wherever they may lead.","Section 1

The old turntable sighed to life, its gentle whir a prelude to the unusual sound about to fill the room. It was late October, the leaves outside crackled under the weight of frost, but the music emanating from the speakers felt distinctly… summery. Here was Kim Myhr, a Norwegian composer whose name I'd stumbled upon in a late-night internet dive, weaving magic. His album, ""You | Me,"" felt beautifully out of season, a sun-dappled anomaly in the gathering gloom.

The opening track, simply titled ""A"" on the vinyl, began to unfurl. Myhr, a master of slow-morphing rhythms, painted sonic landscapes that seemed to glow from within. The electronics were mellow and inviting, like a warm embrace on a chilly day. And his 12-string acoustic guitar! It possessed this loose, blissed-out twang that immediately conjured images of hazy afternoons spent basking in the sun. The simple hook, around which the entire track looped and shimmered, was both grounding and hypnotic.

I recognized the echoes of 60s psych-folk, that era of sonic exploration and free-spirited melodies. But there was something more. A roving thrum, a minimalist pulse, that reminded me of the early work of Steve Reich and Terry Riley, particularly the iconic ""In C."" Even a faint echo of Julius Eastman's joyous ""Femenine"" resonated within the complex tapestry of sound.

Section 2

Then came the drums. Not a frantic, pounding rhythm section, but a subtle, shimmering presence. Three drummers – Ingar Zach, Hans Hulbækmo, and the legendary Tony Buck of The Necks – provided a spangling commentary, a delicate percussion that propelled the music forward with tranquil momentum. Occasionally, the rhythm would drift into sombre eddies, adding depth and texture to the overall soundscape. The change wasn't jarring, but a seamless transition between emotional states.

As ""A"" gave way to ""B,"" the feeling remained consistent: this was an album to bolster the spirits and ground the nerves. It was travelling music for big-sky vistas, even if those vistas existed only within the confines of my own mind. I closed my eyes and let the music transport me, conjuring images of open fields bathed in golden sunlight, a world away from the grey skies outside my window. I realized this wasn't just an album; it was an escape, a temporary reprieve from the encroaching winter. In that moment, ""You | Me"" became more than just music; it became a source of comfort, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, a little bit of sunshine can always be found.

P.S. I ended up ordering more albums from Kim Myhr, hoping to recapture that initial feeling of unexpected warmth. While none struck quite the same chord as ""You | Me,"" they further solidified my appreciation for his unique sonic vision. It seems that the ability to create ""out of season"" beauty is a rare and precious gift.

 The name of this 1640 collection means “moral and spiritual forest” and it is Monteverdi in the most exploratory mood – the culmination of his three decades as maestro di cappella at St Mark’s Basilica in Venice, with its sumptuous acoustic and crack instrumental band and 40-piece choir to match. You’ll find everything from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals, and this recording is best suited to the latter. That’s because conductor Pablo Heras-Casado has a tendency to over-shape the bigger stuff, to traffic-control the corners and smooth out the ride. With Monteverdi, we need the rough and the spontaneous. But individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann are wonderful, and they shine in their nimble duos and trios – try the piercingly delivered Salve Regina from sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner.

In the dimly lit recording studio of Berlin's Teldex Studio, conductor Pablo Heras-Casado raised his baton to the assembled musicians of the Balthasar Neumann Ensemble. The air was thick with anticipation as they prepared to breathe life into Monteverdi's ""Selva morale e spirituale,"" the magnificent 1640 collection whose name translates to ""moral and spiritual forest."" This monumental work represented Monteverdi at his most exploratory, the culmination of three decades of genius as maestro di cappella at Venice's St. Mark's Basilica. Under his direction, the basilica's sumptuous acoustic had been filled with the sounds of a crack instrumental band and a forty-piece choir, creating sacred music of unprecedented emotional depth and technical innovation.

***

Julia Kirchner adjusted her music stand nervously, exchanging a quick glance with her fellow soprano Magdalene Harer. Their duet on ""Salve Regina"" was scheduled for recording that afternoon, and critics had already noted the piercing beauty of their intertwined voices. Unlike some of the grand ensembles that felt somewhat over-shaped under Heras-Casado's meticulous direction, these intimate solo confessionals allowed the individual musicians of the ensemble to truly shine. Julia recalled her first visit to St. Mark's years ago, standing beneath its golden mosaics and imagining Monteverdi himself conducting in that very space, challenging conventional boundaries between sacred devotion and human expression.

***

The recording process had not been without tension. Several senior instrumentalists had privately expressed concerns about Heras-Casado's approach to the larger pieces. ""With Monteverdi, we need the rough and the spontaneous,"" the principal theorbo player had remarked during a coffee break. ""There's a certain wildness in his work that resists too much control."" Yet even the skeptics acknowledged that in the nimble duos and trios, where the conductor's touch was lighter, something magical was happening. The music breathed with an authenticity that transported listeners across four centuries, capturing both the intellectual rigor and emotional immediacy that made Monteverdi revolutionary.

***

As the technicians made final adjustments to the microphone positions, the ensemble's historical consultant passed around facsimiles of Monteverdi's original manuscripts. ""Remember,"" she said, ""this music was composed during the Thirty Years' War, during a plague that devastated Venice. Monteverdi wasn't creating museum pieces but visceral responses to a world in crisis."" This context gave special poignancy to pieces like ""Beatus vir"" and ""Dixit Dominus,"" which moved from moments of profound doubt to transcendent affirmation. The musicians found themselves reflecting on how their interpretation might speak to present-day listeners seeking solace and meaning in their own turbulent times.

***

The completed recording, released to critical acclaim the following spring, succeeded most brilliantly in those intimate moments where Monteverdi's genius for text setting and emotional truth found perfect expression through the Balthasar Neumann musicians. Listeners particularly praised the ""piercingly delivered Salve Regina"" from Harer and Kirchner, noting how these smaller-scale works captured the essence of what made the ""moral and spiritual forest"" so enduring. While some reviewers echoed concerns about over-shaping in the grander pieces, the recording nonetheless offered modern audiences a window into that magnificent acoustic world Monteverdi had commanded at St. Mark's Basilica—where sacred music first learned to fully embrace the complexities of human experience.","In the heart of Venice, rumors swirled about a performance that promised to unveil a secret realm of sound—a “moral and spiritual forest” where the music of Monteverdi was reborn. It was said that this particular 1640 collection had been rediscovered and was now set to challenge the boundaries of tradition. The aged walls of St Mark’s Basilica soon echoed with soft murmurings as locals and curious travelers gathered, eager to experience the transformative power of centuries-old melodies recast for modern ears.

*** 

At the helm of this musical journey was the renowned conductor, Pablo Heras-Casado, whose reputation for precision was both celebrated and critiqued. With decades of experience as maestro di cappella, his interpretations had often been applauded for their grand visions; however, critics noted that his intimate understanding of the delicate nuances sometimes became over-controlled when guiding larger ensembles. On this night, his effort to shape the music was evident—but so too was the tension between meticulous direction and the raw, spontaneous expression that Monteverdi’s work demanded.

***

In one of the quieter rooms of the Basilica, a group of musicians prepared for what would become a captivating interlude. Embracing the unpredictable nature of the piece, individual performers gathered in duos and trios, each session a small conversation between sound and silence. Among them, two sopranos, Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner, took center stage with their piercingly emotional rendition of the Salve Regina. Their voices intertwined, reminding every listener that even in a world meticulously planned, moments of fragility and beauty could emerge unexpectedly.

***

Outside the ornate stone arches, the cool Venetian night mirrored the dynamism of the music within. As the notes cascaded through the vaulted ceilings, the performers and audience alike found themselves immersed in a dialogue with history. The Basilica became more than a space—it turned into a living manuscript of sound, where ancient textures blended with the present in a rare convergence of art and emotion. Each reverberation carried stories of bygone eras, now reinterpreted for an audience eager to feel the pulse of Monteverdi’s spirit.

***

By the time the final chords faded into the stillness, it was clear that the performance had transcended a mere concert. It was an invitation to rediscover the beauty in imperfection—a gentle reminder that even the most calculated orchestral renderings needed the rough, spontaneous edges that define true art. In that moment, as echoes of the “moral and spiritual forest” mingled with whispered memories and newfound passions, both maestro and musician, conductor and listener, were united in a shared, timeless celebration of Monteverdi’s transformative legacy.","Monteverdi's 1640 collection, ""Selva Morale e Spirituale,"" meaning ""moral and spiritual forest,"" represents the composer at his most exploratory. Culminating his three decades as maestro di cappella at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, the work leverages the basilica's sumptuous acoustic, a crack instrumental band, and a matching 40-piece choir. The collection offers a vast range, from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals. However, this particular recording shines brightest in the latter, its more subtle and personal offerings.

***

Conductor Pablo Heras-Casado's approach appears to favor the smaller, more delicate pieces. He has a tendency to over-shape the bigger compositions, exerting too much control over the grander movements, smoothing out the inherent rawness. With Monteverdi, a certain roughness and spontaneity is desired, a quality somewhat diminished in Heras-Casado's handling of the larger pieces. He seems to over-control these larger pieces, which detracts from the overall natural tone of the musical pieces.

***

Despite this, the individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann are truly wonderful. Their talents are most evident in the nimble duos and trios, where their individual skills can truly shine. These smaller ensembles bring a level of intimacy and precision that is captivating, showcasing the ensemble's technical prowess and nuanced interpretation of Monteverdi's work. The smaller pieces allow the listener to truly focus on the individual musicians.

***

A prime example of this is the piercingly delivered ""Salve Regina,"" performed by sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner. Their voices blend beautifully, creating a moving and powerful rendition of the piece. It is a testament to their vocal control and emotional depth. The two women's voices complement one another perfectly, creating a sublime listening experience.

***

Ultimately, this recording of ""Selva Morale e Spirituale"" offers a mixed bag. While the grander ensembles might suffer from a slightly heavy-handed approach, the intimate duos and trios, particularly the ""Salve Regina,"" are a true delight. It is a testament to the enduring power of Monteverdi's music, even with varying interpretations, and showcases the remarkable talent of the Balthasar Neumann ensemble. The collection, on the whole, remains an impressive feat of musical composition.

 ECHOES THROUGH TIME Some things never change. Consider the events of January 1907, for example, when Liverpool travelled to a frozen Roker Park and built themselves a comfy 4-1 half-time lead. Jack Parkinson, Sam Raybould and Jack Cox were scintillating in attack, coming at hosts Sunderland from all angles, at pace, “like a fleet of ships” according to the Liverpool Echo. But as the paper also pointed out, “a battle is never lost until it is won”, and Sunderland came back out for the second half in determined fashion. Liverpool started conceding rash fouls and penalty kicks, the not-yet-woke Manchester Guardian observing that Sunderland’s comeback was because of a “fatal departure on the part of Liverpool from the clean game, which is by no means necessarily tame and effeminate”. The end result was 5-5. It was the first time Liverpool had ever given up a three-goal lead. Oh Liverpool! Did something horrific take hold in the Liverpool psyche that day? Well, just consider the evidence.

Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.",story_generation,"""In the frosty January of 1907, Liverpool's journey to Roker Park became the stuff of legend, a tale that would echo through the corridors of football history for generations to come, establishing a peculiar pattern in the club's DNA that fans would recognize with a mixture of pride and pain over a century later. The Liverpool squad, spearheaded by the brilliant attacking trio of Jack Parkinson, Sam Raybould, and Jack Cox, had built what seemed an unassailable 4-1 lead by halftime, their movements described poetically by the Liverpool Echo as coming at Sunderland 'like a fleet of ships,' swift and coordinated, overwhelming the home defense with their precision and power. But as the players returned for the second half, something inexplicable happened to the Liverpool mentality—a shadow fell across their play, a tenseness gripped their limbs, and the disciplined formation that had served them so well began to disintegrate, giving way to rash challenges and unnecessary fouls that gifted Sunderland penalty kicks and opportunities to claw their way back into the contest. The Manchester Guardian, in its somewhat antiquated language, pinpointed the problem as a 'fatal departure... from the clean game,' suggesting that Liverpool had abandoned their principles and poise, leading to a stunning 5-5 draw that marked the first time in their history that they had surrendered a three-goal advantage. This collapse seemed to burn itself into the collective psychology of the club, creating a strange susceptibility to dramatic implosions that would resurface throughout their history—from the 1964 FA Cup quarter-final against Swansea where they blew a 2-0 lead, to the infamous 2005 Champions League final in Istanbul where they miraculously recovered from 3-0 down against AC Milan (the reverse scenario), to more recent heartbreaks like the 2013-14 Premier League campaign when a 3-0 lead against Crystal Palace evaporated in the final minutes. The psychic wound of that January day in 1907 appears to have created an almost mystic vulnerability in Liverpool's collective consciousness, a peculiar tendency to never quite believe a game is won until the final whistle, as if the ghosts of Roker Park occasionally whisper in the ears of Liverpool players across the decades, reminding them of football's capacity for dramatic reversals of fortune. Perhaps there is something in the Mersey waters, or in the passionate expectation of the Anfield faithful, that creates this strange duality in Liverpool's character—capable of the most sublime, attacking football one moment, and puzzling fragility the next—a pattern first established on that frozen field in Sunderland, when Liverpool learned the hard way that in football, as in life, nothing is certain until it's over.""","""On a frostbitten January day in 1907, Liverpool embarked on a journey that transcended mere sport as they stepped onto the glacial embrace of Roker Park, their ambitions twined with the spectral echoes of time and the promised allure of an invincible lead that would soon become a fabled metaphor for the unpredictable nature of destiny. The champions of that half—the illustrious Jack Parkinson, Sam Raybould, and Jack Cox—danced across the pitch with a brilliance that the Liverpool Echo immortalized by likening their relentless onslaught to a fleet of majestic ships sweeping unchallenged across the turbulent sea of competition, a vivid image that soon seeped into the fabric of sporting lore. Yet, as the match unfurled its dramatic tapestry, the early triumph was fated to be overshadowed by a relentless surge from a determined Sunderland side whose second-half rally, inspired by a resolve as unforgiving as winter’s chill, transformed the contest into an epic drama where the adage 'a battle is never lost until it is won' resonated with a bitter clarity. In the shifting sands of rivalry that saw the clean, poetic elegance of Liverpool’s initial play marred by rash fouls and precipitous penalty kicks, a narrative of transformation took hold, with even the hallowed words of the not-yet-woke Manchester Guardian critiquing the departure from fair play into a realm replete with raw aggression and startling abandonment of sportsmanlike grace. As the final whistle coalesced with the surreal spectacle of a 5-5 scoreline—a result that defied the natural order of expectations and broke the once-untarnished legacy of a three-goal lead—the city of Liverpool was left to grapple with an existential question that echoed 'Oh Liverpool!' in an ironic lament for a psyche besieged by fleeting glory and the inexorable pull of downfall. In the wake of that breathtaking encounter, the spirit of the players and the collective soul of an entire community were irrevocably altered, as storytellers, poets, and fans alike began to weave this match into the grand tapestry of myth and memory, where every kick of the ball emerged as a metaphor for the eternal struggle between brilliance and hubris. Generations later, the legend of that extraordinary game endured as a cautionary tale, a profound parable evoking both triumph and tragedy, compelling supporters from both sides of the pitch to ponder the deeper mysteries gleaned from a single winter day that revealed how victory’s fragile veneer can shatter under the weight of ambition and fate. Ultimately, as the echoes of that historic contest continue to resonate across the annals of time, every spectator and player is reminded that within the transient moments of sporting passion lies a timeless lesson: that the heart of any battle is not merely measured by the scoreline, but by the enduring capacity of the human spirit to rise, reflect, and transform the bitter taste of loss into a legacy of eternal resilience.""","""The biting January wind whipped across Roker Park in 1907, mirroring the frenetic energy of Liverpool's attack as they dismantled Sunderland in the first half, a seemingly insurmountable 4-1 lead etched onto the frozen scoreboard, a trio of names – Parkinson, Raybould, and Cox – forever linked in the annals of Liverpool's early footballing history, their performance described by the Liverpool Echo as a relentless ""fleet of ships"" bearing down on the Sunderland defense. However, the seeds of disaster, unseen beneath the veneer of dominance, were already sown, as the Echo subtly cautioned, reminding readers that victory remained elusive until definitively claimed, a sentiment that would soon prove hauntingly prophetic. Emerging from the halftime break, Sunderland underwent a startling transformation, fueled by a renewed determination and perhaps, a hint of desperation, their play gaining momentum while Liverpool, conversely, seemed to unravel, gifting away their advantage through a series of rash fouls and ill-advised penalty kicks, a decline the Manchester Guardian, in its pre-woke era, attributed to a ""fatal departure… from the clean game,"" a lapse in sportsmanship that, according to the paper, was both unnecessary and ultimately self-defeating, implying a loss of discipline and perhaps even a touch of arrogance that invited retribution. The unfolding drama culminated in a 5-5 draw, a scoreline that etched itself into Liverpool's collective memory, marking the first time the club had ever surrendered a three-goal lead, leaving fans and pundits alike to question whether this unprecedented collapse represented a mere aberration or a harbinger of a deeper, more systemic vulnerability within the team's psychological makeup, a susceptibility to pressure and a tendency towards self-sabotage that could resurface in future matches. This debacle at Roker Park seemed to linger like a bad omen, raising the unsettling question of whether the team and its fans were destined to re-experience similar heartbreaks throughout the club's history. A century later, echoes of that fateful day at Roker Park reverberate through the corridors of Anfield, a constant reminder of the fragility of even the most commanding leads, a testament to the enduring power of resilience, and an implicit warning against complacency, Liverpool supporters have felt this pain repeatedly since that fateful day at Roker Park, and it has become part of the fabric of the club. This historic collapse has acted as a cautionary tale that has been told over and over again through the history of the club. Now as Liverpool fans watch their team take to the pitch, even when they are up multiple goals, the haunting memory of the 5-5 draw from 1907 looms large in the back of their minds. It is a constant reminder that no lead is safe, and that the game is never truly over until the final whistle blows. As many Liverpool fans say ""Once bitten, twice shy"", and the memory of the Roker Park collapse has shaped the club's and its fans' perception of themselves."""

 Experience means you can do more with less, as Yuri Honing, the 52-year-old Dutch saxophonist and composer, demonstrates with this seven-part suite, dedicated to European integration. Honing has worked with two late great jazz pianists in Misha Mengelberg and Paul Bley, explored Schubert song cycles, taken inspiration from dancers and pop singers, from political history and visual art. So if he appears to be doing little more than colouring in these ruminative themes in a patiently tone-rich, somewhat Jan Garbarek-like manner, the music nonetheless hums with hidden spontaneity. Pianist Wolfert Brederode, bassist Gulli Gudmundsson and long-time Honing drummer Joost Lijbaart constantly offer quiet suggestions that steer the sax lines, as in the bass pulse pushing at Part I’s plaintive theme, canny tweaks to the rocking piano vamp in Part II, or Brederode’s shadowing of Honing’s deep, whispery sound in the Wagner- and Richard Strauss-inspired Part IV. A dead cert for admirers of Garbarek’s and Tord Gustavsen’s music, but the sources, vision and seriousness here are all Honing’s own.

Yuri Honing stood quietly in the wings of the Amsterdam Concert Hall, his weathered saxophone hanging from his neck, a testament to decades of musical exploration. At 52, the Dutch musician had learned that true artistry often resided in restraint rather than excess.

Tonight's performance would debut his seven-part suite dedicated to European integration, a project born from his concern about the political fragmentation threatening the continent he loved.

""Five minutes, Yuri,"" whispered Wolfert Brederode, his pianist and longtime collaborator. Behind them, bassist Gulli Gudmundsson tuned his instrument while drummer Joost Lijbaart adjusted his cymbals with characteristic precision.

""Remember when we first played together?"" Wolfert asked with a nostalgic smile. ""You were already working with Mengelberg then.""

Yuri nodded, memories of sessions with the innovative Misha Mengelberg and later with Paul Bley washing over him. Those giants had taught him to trust silence as much as sound, to let music breathe rather than forcing it into submission.

The house lights dimmed. As Yuri walked onto the stage, he felt the weight of his diverse musical journey—his explorations of Schubert, collaborations with dancers, inspirations drawn from visual art and political history. All of it had brought him here.

The audience fell silent as the quartet began Part I, Yuri's plaintive theme rising above Gulli's pulsing bass. Though critics might compare his tone-rich approach to Jan Garbarek's sound, Yuri knew this music carried its own distinct voice—one speaking of European unity through subtle conversation rather than proclamation.

In Part II, Wolfert introduced subtle changes to the rocking piano vamp, creating new pathways for Yuri's saxophone to explore. By Part IV, with its echoes of Wagner and Richard Strauss, Brederode was delicately shadowing Honing's deep, whispery sound, their musical dialogue representing the intimate connections between nations.

Throughout the performance, Yuri did more with less, allowing space for his bandmates' quiet suggestions to steer his saxophone lines. The music hummed with hidden spontaneity, each note carefully chosen yet somehow surprising.

When the final notes faded, the audience remained still for several moments before erupting into applause. A critic in the front row—known for his devotion to Garbarek and Tord Gustavsen—nodded appreciatively, recognizing that while the influences might be familiar, Honing's vision and seriousness were uniquely his own.

Later, as they packed their instruments, Joost turned to Yuri. ""You know what I love about playing your compositions? They're conversations, not monologues.""

Yuri smiled. After decades of musical exploration, he had learned that integration—whether of musical styles or European nations—required both individual voice and collective listening. His saxophone case closed with a satisfying click, another performance complete but the musical journey continuing.

Any other questions?","Yuri Honing, the renowned Dutch saxophonist and composer, embarked on an intimate musical journey one crisp autumn evening at an enchanting concert hall in Amsterdam. His performance, a seven-part suite dedicated to celebrating European integration, unfolded like a rich tapestry woven from threads of tradition and innovation. Honing, drawing on decades of experience and the wisdom gleaned from collaborations with jazz luminaries like Misha Mengelberg and Paul Bley, skillfully merged reflective themes with spontaneous interludes that set the stage for a dialogue across generations.

The suite opened with a plaintive melody, the soulful sound of Honing’s saxophone inviting listeners into a world where every note carried a sense of purpose. As the performance progressed, the interplay between pianist Wolfert Brederode, bassist Gulli Gudmundsson, and Honing’s steadfast drummer, Joost Lijbaart, created an environment of subtle conversation rather than exhibition. Each segment of the suite offered its own emotional landscape—from mild introspection to a carefully constructed build-up reminiscent of passages in classical compositions, hinting at influences drawn from both political history and visual art.

In moments of intricate musical nuance, the ensemble’s careful suggestions steered the narrative of sound with hints of improvisation that felt both unexpected and deeply genuine. The piano’s gentle cascades echoed through the hall as the bass provided a rhythmic counterpoint, all underpinned by Honing’s ever-present, contemplative sax lines. This melding of crafted compositions with hidden spontaneity underscored the performance’s core message: a celebration of the unifying power of art.

Critics praised the event not only for its virtuosity but also for its evocative commentary on the spirit of integration—a quiet reminder of the shared cultural heritage and aspirations that connect diverse communities. As the last note reverberated through the hall, the audience was left enveloped in a reflective silence that mirrored the profound, unspoken messages carried by the music.

Honing's rich history, having collaborated with jazz giants Misha Mengelberg and Paul Bley, delving into Schubert's song cycles, and drawing inspiration from dancers, pop singers, political history, and visual art, informs his subtle yet potent compositions.

While the initial impression might be one of simple melodic coloring, echoing Jan Garbarek's style in its patient tone, the music vibrates with a concealed spontaneity. The core quartet, featuring pianist Wolfert Brederode, bassist Gulli Gudmundsson, and Honing's longtime drummer Joost Lijbaart, works as a cohesive unit, offering understated guidance that shapes Honing’s saxophone melodies. Listen closely, and one can detect the bass's insistent pulse beneath the plaintive melody of Part I, the clever adjustments within Part II's rocking piano vamp, and Brederode’s echo of Honing's deep, soft tone in Part IV, influenced by Wagner and Richard Strauss.

In the elegant drawing room of a Wimpole Street residence in 1871 London, the final preparations were underway. The piano had been positioned perfectly, sheet music arranged with precision, and the small but talented choir assembled in formation. This evening would mark a historic moment – the introduction of Brahms's German Requiem to London society, performed in English with a piano four hands accompaniment, honoring the composer's commitment to vernacular accessibility.

Lady Elizabeth Montgomery, the evening's patron, surveyed the room with anxious eyes. ""Professor Harrington,"" she called to the choir director, ""are we quite ready? The guests will arrive within the hour.""

Professor James Harrington, a dedicated advocate for Brahms's work, nodded confidently. ""Indeed, Lady Montgomery. The choir has mastered the English translation, and our pianists have revised the accompaniment to better capture Brahms's orchestral textures. It shall be an intimate rendering, but true to the spirit of the composition.""

Mary Bevan, the young soprano selected for the solo, practiced quietly in a corner. Her voice had an ethereal quality that had captured Harrington's attention during auditions. Her tone was divine, nearly perfect, but her diction remained a concern. The professor had worked with her extensively, yet some words still lacked clarity when she sang.

""Miss Bevan,"" Harrington approached her gently, ""remember what we discussed about the consonants. They must cut through like a knife through butter, even in the softest passages.""

Mary nodded earnestly. ""Yes, Professor. I shall do my very best.""

As the fashionable crowd assembled that evening, excitement rippled through the drawing room. The young choir, bright-faced and earnest, took their positions. The pianists seated themselves at the instrument, hands poised above the keys.

What followed was a performance of remarkable intimacy and emotional power. The chamber arrangement created a visceral connection between performers and audience. The choir sang with bright, youthful vigor, each word perfectly articulated. The revised piano part, crafted to echo Brahms's orchestral vision, filled the room with surprising richness.

When Mary rose for her solo, the room fell into reverent silence. Her voice soared, angelic and pure, filling every corner of the space with its beauty. Yet, as Professor Harrington had feared, certain words disappeared into the melody, their meaning lost in the cloud of her otherwise flawless tone.

After the final notes faded, there was a moment of profound silence before thunderous applause erupted. Lady Montgomery's gamble had paid off – Brahms's Requiem, performed in this novel manner, had touched the hearts of London's musical elite.

As the evening concluded, Professor Harrington approached Mary. ""Your voice, my dear, was truly divine. With some work on your diction, you shall be unmatched.""

Mary smiled, understanding both the compliment and the criticism. ""I shall practice, Professor. For the next performance, every word will be as clear as it is beautiful.""

The Wimpole Street performance would later be recognized as a pivotal moment in introducing Brahms's masterwork to English audiences, proving that great music could transcend both language and instrumental arrangement when performed with conviction and understanding.

P.P.S. This story is a fictional elaboration based on the information provided in the Guardian article excerpt. The characters of Lady Montgomery, Professor Harrington, and the interpretation of Mary Bevan's experience are all creative inventions to serve the narrative.","In the heart of London’s artistic community, a passionate conductor named Lydia embarked on an ambitious project to resurrect the spirit of Brahms’s great German Requiem. Inspired by the historic performance in an elegant Wimpole Street drawing room in 1871, Lydia delved into the archives and discovered that Brahms himself had insisted on using the vernacular for his chosen texts. Determined to honor his ideals, she assembled a talented group of young singers and a pair of seasoned pianists, the latter entrusted with one of Brahms’s very own pianos for a performance arranged for four hands.

Lydia’s vision was clear: she sought to capture the intimate yet powerful interplay between voice and instrument by revising the classical piano part so that it echoed the rich textures of Brahms’s orchestration. During rehearsals, the musicians immersed themselves in the subtle details of the score, uncovering nuances often overlooked in larger orchestral settings. They experimented with dynamics and enunciation, keen to balance the intricate harmonic explorations with the heartfelt vocal expressions that had defined the original performances.

As the day of the recording approached, tensions mingled with excitement. Among the performers was Mary, a gifted soloist whose voice possessed a transcendent quality that promised to transport listeners. Although her solo moments glittered with divine brilliance, Lydia’s ear noted occasional lapses in clarity—a reminder that even genius must wrestle with imperfection. Undeterred, the team refined every detail, striving relentlessly for a performance that both evoked the past and resonated with modern sensibilities.

On the evening of the concert, the intimate chamber was bathed in soft light and nostalgic whispers of history. The performance unfolded as a tapestry of emotions: the revised piano accompaniment interwove with the choir’s earnest delivery, breathing life into Brahms’s cherished text in English. The intimacy of the small venue allowed every fluctuation and nuance to be shared intimately among the audience, ensuring that every listener experienced a personal moment of communion with the music.

The success of the project was not merely in recreating history, but in bridging the gap between a storied past and a vibrant present. Lydia’s innovative approach and unwavering dedication paid homage to Brahms’s ideals while showcasing the transformative power of revisiting and reinterpreting classical masterpieces.

Brahms chose the text of his great German Requiem consciously in the vernacular of his country, so those who first introduced it to London decided to pay homage to his ideals and perform it in English, with Brahms’s own piano (four hands) accompaniment. A shiver ran down Eleanor's spine. Tonight's performance promised a similar intimacy.

This recording, the notes explained, used similar forces to those who gathered in a fashionable Wimpole Street drawing room in 1871, but revised the piano part to more closely reflect the textures of Brahms’s orchestration. Eleanor had always preferred the orchestral version, its grandeur echoing the vastness of grief and hope. But the promise of something more intimate, more personal, was alluring.

This produces an intimate, highly charged chamber performance, brightly, but sometimes too lightly, sung by this young choir, with exemplary enunciation. The hall, once a private residence itself, felt charged with anticipation. The first notes rang out, clear and precise, almost too delicate for such weighty material. Eleanor found herself fluctuating between admiration for the choir’s technical skill and a yearning for more depth, more resonance.

Alas, clouded diction spoils an otherwise divine solo from Mary Bevan. The soprano’s voice, initially soaring and pure, suddenly faltered. A muddle of sounds obscured the words, the meaning blurring. A collective sigh seemed to ripple through the audience, a shared disappointment at the imperfection marring the moment. Eleanor closed her eyes, trying to recapture the feeling of the earlier movements, the promise of that intimate chamber experience. Despite the solo’s flaw, the overall effect was still powerful, a testament to Brahms’s enduring genius.

 Google has confirmed it has been able to track the location of Android users via the addresses of local mobile phone masts, even when location services were turned off and the sim cards removed to protect privacy. Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.

In the quiet suburbs of San Francisco, Alex had always been vigilant about his privacy. As a tech journalist specializing in digital rights, he prided himself on understanding the hidden mechanics of the devices we carry with us daily. That's why, when preparing to attend a confidential meeting with a whistleblower, he took every precaution: turning off location services on his Android phone, removing the SIM card, and even disabling Wi-Fi. His body tensed with a sense of security as he walked to the meeting point.

Little did he know that his phone was still betraying him.

The Guardian's explosive report revealed what Alex had long suspected but couldn't prove: Google had been tracking Android users through cell tower addresses (Cell ID) since early 2017, even when users explicitly opted out of such tracking. This ""feature"" operated silently in the background, collecting data that could pinpoint a user's location within 400 meters—sometimes with even greater precision in urban areas.

""This is a fundamental breach of trust,"" Alex wrote in his subsequent article. ""Users expect that when they disable a service, it actually stops. The return of location data to Google servers, despite users taking every reasonable precaution, demonstrates how tech companies prioritize data collection over user privacy.""

Google's response came swiftly. A spokesperson claimed they began using Cell ID data merely to ""improve the speed and performance of message delivery"" but never incorporated it into their network sync system. The data, they insisted, was ""immediately discarded.""

Privacy advocates weren't convinced. The Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handled notifications and required a persistent connection, served as the perfect vehicle for this tracking. While ostensibly designed to minimize battery drain through ""heartbeat analysis,"" the collection of cell tower information seemed unnecessary for this purpose.

For users like Maria, a domestic violence survivor who relied on privacy tools to protect herself from her abuser, such revelations were terrifying. ""I thought I was safe,"" she told Alex in an interview. ""Now I learn that even with everything turned off, I could still be found.""

Tech companies had long justified data collection by pointing to the ad ecosystem that funded free services, but this particular case stretched beyond the usual privacy-for-convenience bargain. Users had explicitly opted out.

Following public outcry, Google announced they had updated their systems to no longer request Cell ID information. But for privacy experts like Alex, the damage was done. Trust, once broken, was difficult to restore.

""This isn't just about one feature or one company,"" Alex concluded in his widely-shared editorial. ""It's about the fundamental relationship between technology providers and users. When we can't trust the off switch to actually turn something off, we've entered dangerous territory.""","Google has confirmed that its Android system, long praised for its seamless service integration, has been tracking users’ locations in a way that has raised serious privacy concerns. According to a recent report, Android devices began requesting the unique addresses of local mobile phone masts—known as Cell ID—as early as 2017. This feature, originally intended to improve the speed and reliability of push notifications and messaging services, inadvertently provided a way to triangulate a device’s position even when location services were turned off and the sim card removed.

The underlying body of the system's functionality was designed to support Firebase Cloud Messaging. By using data that included the mobile country and network codes, Android devices could determine the optimal number of pings to Google’s servers without unnecessary battery drain. However, the same data used to maintain service connectivity was also enough to potentially locate users to a radius of around 400 meters—and even more precisely in urban areas.

This revelation has prompted a return to public discussion about digital privacy and the trade-offs often made in pursuit of better service performance. A Google spokesperson explained that in January of that year, an initiative was launched to incorporate Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further enhance message delivery. However, Google clarified that the new ad-hoc data was never integrated into their network sync system; instead, it was promptly discarded after this experimental phase.

Critics argue that, despite the strong privacy expectations of users, such practices—regardless of intent—could compromise personal privacy. The incident also highlights the broader issue in the digital world: the balance between innovative features designed to optimize service performance and protecting user privacy. As discussion around the subject grows, both users and experts are calling on tech companies to be more transparent about data practices and to ensure that new features do not come at the expense of personal privacy.

While the specific benefits of triangulating a mobile phone mast’s address for message reliability remain somewhat ambiguous, this episode serves as a pointed reminder of the importance of maintaining a clear and accountable relationship between technology development and user privacy rights.","The revelation that Google tracked Android users' locations through mobile phone mast addresses, even with location **services** disabled and SIM cards removed, sparked a firestorm of privacy concerns. Quartz's report detailed how Google's Android system, responsible for delivering push notifications, began requesting unique Cell IDs at the start of 2017.

A Google spokesperson admitted the practice, stating that the Cell IDs were intended to improve message delivery speed and performance. However, they claimed the data was never integrated into their network sync system and was immediately discarded, with the practice discontinued. Alongside Cell IDs, Google also requested the mobile country code and mobile network code, information used for heartbeat analysis to optimize the connection to Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging system and minimize battery drain.

While the claimed benefit of mobile phone mast addresses for message **service** reliability remained murky, the potential for triangulation was clear. This method, similar to that used with active location **services**, could pinpoint a user's location within a 400m radius, often more accurately in urban environments. The data's potential use for targeted **ad** campaigns, personalized recommendations, or even law enforcement access, raised disturbing questions about the tech giant's data practices.

The incident underscored the ongoing tension between technological advancement and individual privacy. Users felt betrayed, their reasonable expectation of privacy violated. Many questioned if Google would ever truly **return** to valuing customer privacy. The damage to public trust was significant. The incident highlighted the importance of transparency and accountability in the tech industry, forcing users to scrutinize the terms of **service** and data collection practices of even the most trusted brands.

 Here is one of the final screen appearances of Emmanuelle Riva, icon of movies from Michael Haneke’s Amour to Gillo Pontecorvo’s Kapò and Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour, who died in January at the age of 89. It is a delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing performance. Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard.

The fire of creativity still burned brightly in Emmanuelle Riva's eyes, even in what would become one of her final performances. Playing the endearingly scatterbrained Marthe in the whimsical comedy ""Lost in Paris,"" Riva brought a gentle elegance to the role that perfectly complemented the film's Tati-esque charm. As her niece Fiona journeyed from Canada to Paris to visit her, neither could have predicted the series of fortunate misadventures that awaited them in the City of Light, where even the most ordinary street corner could transform into a stage for the extraordinary.

Section 2
The meeting between Fiona and Dom occurred in classic comedic fashion—through mishap and circumstance. After slipping on the banks of the Seine and tumbling into its murky waters, Fiona emerged soaked but fortunate to encounter Dom, a philosophical tramp with a romantic soul. ""Some people find love in ballrooms,"" Dom would later quote from his favorite poet, ""but we found ours in the river of life."" Their awkward introduction set the wheel of fate spinning, creating a connection that would carry them through the film's delightful narrative.

Section 3
Marthe's apartment became the central hub of their adventures—a quirky space filled with mementos from her illustrious past. Photographs from film sets lined the walls, including images from ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" and ""Amour,"" subtle nods to Riva's remarkable career. When Fiona finally located her aunt after a series of comical misunderstandings, Marthe greeted her with characteristic absentmindedness: ""Oh my dear, I was expecting you yesterday... or perhaps tomorrow?"" Her home existed outside conventional time, much like the film itself, which could have been made in any decade of French cinema.

Section 4
As the story unfolded, Dom introduced Fiona to his unique perspective on Parisian society. While tourists flocked to the Eiffel Tower and Louvre, Dom knew the hidden cafés where veteran performers like Pierre Richard might be spotted sipping espresso. The film's dance sequences—particularly the unexpected tango that Dom and Fiona performed at a riverside restaurant—revealed the characters' inner passions beneath their awkward exteriors. The choreography became a metaphor for their relationship: chaotic yet somehow harmonious.

Section 5
What distinguished ""Lost in Paris"" was its sophisticated simplicity—a childlike wonder paired with mature filmmaking techniques. Directors Abel and Gordon crafted a love letter to classic French comedy while maintaining their distinctive visual style. The film celebrated serendipity, suggesting that getting lost might be the surest path to finding oneself. As Marthe wisely observed while feeding pigeons in the park, ""Life is like Paris—the more you wander without direction, the more treasures you discover.""

The narrative opens with Marthe, the spirited lady known for her childlike guilelessness, preparing for an evening of frivolity in the heart of Paris. Yet beneath the veneer of classic French entertainment lies a secret: a passion for the unexpected that once ignited her love for cinema—a mysterious fire that transformed her view of art and life.

Section 2
Marthe’s journey takes an unpredictable twist when, during a casual stroll along the banks of the Seine, she encounters a quirky troupe of directors and actors passionately debating the evolution of modern society. Their meeting, organized by fate and a mischievous twist of destiny, revolves around a recurring theme: the delicate interplay between the old world charm of classic cinema and the contemporary narratives of today. This serendipitous meeting sparks an array of emotions reminiscent of a long-forgotten era.

Section 3
Within this eclectic troupe, Fiona—a young, endearingly clumsy artistic soul from Canada—stands out for her raw talent and insouciant humor. As she collaborates with seasoned French artists, including a cameo by a charismatic veteran known simply as Pierre, she often remembers a quote that has guided her artistic journey: “Art is a wheel of fortune—ever spinning, ever revealing new paths.” The quote perfectly encapsulates the cyclical nature of creativity and life, intertwining past wisdom with modern insight.

Emmanuelle Riva, a face etched in the memories of cinephiles who cherished *Amour*, *Kapò*, and *Hiroshima Mon Amour*, graced the screen one last time before her passing at 89. Her final performance, a ""delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing"" portrayal of Marthe, a ""lovably scatty old lady,"" stood out. She became a legend in *society*, inspiring people with her commitment to her craft. This swan song occurred within the whimsical world crafted by Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon, French writer-directors known for their Tati-esque comedies. The film itself, a collaborative effort both behind and in front of the camera, was a quirky, humorous escape, decidedly removed from the harsh realities of the everyday. A *wheel* was prominently placed in the film.

Section 2

The plot revolved around Fiona, a young Canadian with a penchant for the fantastical, arriving in Paris to see her Aunt Marthe. Their reunion, however, was disrupted by an accidental dip in the Seine. This aquatic mishap led to an unexpected *meeting* with Dom, a romantic tramp who embodied the carefree spirit of classic French cinema. This entertainment brought up memories of older times. The narrative felt timeless, as if plucked from any point in the last sixty years of French cinematic history. A scene included the *fire* department.

Section 3

Veteran French comedian Pierre Richard added a touch of familiar charm with a cameo appearance. The film, reminiscent of Abel and Gordon's earlier work, *Rumba*, shared the same sweet-natured quality. Furthermore, it featured moments of passionate tango, adding another layer of artistic flair to the already rich tapestry. It was a light-hearted, sweet performance, and a classic French entertainment for the ages.

Section 4

Critics were enchanted. One critic offered a glowing *quote*: ""A little gem! A perfect sendoff for a legend."" The unworldliness of it stood in stark contrast to the current trends in cinema. This escape into a world of playful naiveté and visual gags offered a refreshing alternative, a welcome respite from the often-grim reflections of reality. It felt almost revolutionary in its simplicity, a defiant act of joy in a world increasingly defined by cynicism. The *society* of cinephiles came to celebrate it, remembering Riva's contribution to the medium.

Section 5

Beyond the immediate entertainment value, the film served as a touching tribute to Emmanuelle Riva. It wasn’t just a final performance; it was a celebration of her life, her artistry, and her indelible mark on cinema. The character of Marthe, though ""scatty,"" possessed a profound wisdom and warmth, qualities that mirrored Riva's own persona. In a world obsessed with the new, this film championed the enduring power of classic storytelling and the timeless appeal of human connection. It was a reminder that even in the face of mortality, art could transcend boundaries and leave a lasting legacy.

P.S. The film's success led to a resurgence in interest in Riva's earlier work.

 Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook It’s great to learn that wind ops will have to be declared in the future and the British Horseracing Authority is due plenty of credit for taking another punter-friendly step towards openness in the Nick Rust era. It’s another piece of information that will help anyone making a serious attempt to understand the game and that is an indisputably good thing in my book. The reaction on social media has been, um, interesting. Some trainers appear not to think very highly of punters, judging by responses to the effect that punters will be terribly disappointed when they learn that many (most?) wind ops do not improve a horse’s performance. Surely no one imagines that being told about wind ops is the same thing as getting the keys to the mint. It couldn’t possibly be that, even if wind ops worked all the time. Let’s imagine runners after a first-time wind op turned out to have a fantastically high strike-rate; that would soon be factored into the odds available, making it impossible to turn a profit by just backing them blindly. While trainers flatter themselves that their job is far too complex for us to understand, it seems that some of them have trouble comprehending how betting works. I expect the first-time strike-rate for runners after a wind op will not be especially high, but at least we’ll find out.

In a significant move towards transparency in horse racing, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has announced that wind operations performed on horses will now have to be declared to the public. This decision, implemented under Nick Rust's leadership, represents a positive shift for punters who have long sought greater openness in the sport.

Wind operations, surgical procedures designed to improve a horse's breathing during high-intensity exercise, have historically been kept private. The new requirement to disclose these interventions provides bettors with additional information that could influence their wagering decisions.

The announcement has sparked mixed reactions across the racing community. On social media, some trainers have expressed skepticism, suggesting that punters might overestimate the impact of these procedures on race outcomes. Their comments imply that many wind operations don't significantly enhance a horse's performance, and that punters might be disappointed when they discover this reality.

However, this perspective misunderstands what informed bettors are actually seeking. Knowledgeable punters don't view wind operation information as a guaranteed path to profitable betting. They recognize that even if such procedures consistently improved performance, the betting market would quickly adjust the odds to reflect this advantage, eliminating any simple profit opportunity.

The value lies in having more complete information about each runner. As the author points out, the actual strike-rate for horses following wind operations may not prove exceptional, but the important thing is that this data will now be available for analysis.

This policy change represents another step in modernizing horse racing, making it more accessible to those who want to understand the nuances of the sport rather than rely on insider knowledge. For a sport that depends on betting interest, such transparency measures are essential for maintaining public confidence and engagement in the long term.","<<Racing Winds: Unraveling the Betting Puzzle>>

In what may well be heralded as a turning point in the racing world, the announcement that wind ops must be declared has stirred both anticipation and skepticism in equal measure. The British Horseracing Authority has taken a decisive step towards greater transparency, a move that many believe will empower punters and provide much-needed clarity in the once murky realm of race analytics.

For years, the inside workings of wind ops—a procedure once shrouded in secrecy—were known only to a select few. Now, as the industry gears up for sweeping changes in how information is shared, conversations among trainers, bettors, and racing enthusiasts have erupted across social media. Some trainers, clearly unamused by the growing transparency, have dismissed the impact of wind ops on performance, suggesting that the revelation of these details might do little more than validate what many already suspected: that the key to successful betting lies in a complex mix of skill, chance, and nuanced judgment.

Veteran betting experts chime in with a measured perspective. They point out that even if a first-time wind op were to yield an unexpectedly high strike-rate for a runner, the market is quick to adjust. Odds would shift in real time, making it increasingly challenging for punters to secure a profit simply by relying on the initial buzz surrounding each wind op. This interplay between new information and market dynamics promises to usher in a new era of strategic betting, one where every declared wind op is weighed against historical data, form guides, and an ever-changing set of variables.

Amidst the fervor, there remains a cautious optimism. Some industry insiders argue that despite the trainers’ dismissive tone, the move towards transparency will ultimately benefit the sport. By demystifying one of racing’s longstanding enigmas, the British Horseracing Authority is championing a more level playing field. Moreover, the initiative has ignited a broader discussion about the responsibilities of racing professionals. It challenges all stakeholders to rethink long-held assumptions and to acknowledge that in today’s fast-evolving betting landscape, a single piece of information—even one as seemingly innocuous as wind ops—can have far-reaching implications.

As race day approaches and the first declarations of wind ops begin to flood public channels, punters everywhere are waiting with bated breath. Will the new system reveal hidden trends that can be turned to profit, or is it simply a case of information overload, with the market quickly neutralizing any potential advantage? In the coming weeks, as race results and betting patterns align, the true impact of the British Horseracing Authority’s initiative will be put to the test, reshaping the dialogue around performance analysis and betting strategy for years to come.","<<Transparency Triumphs: Horseracing Embraces Openness>>

Chris Cook reports on a significant advancement in British horseracing: the mandatory declaration of wind operations. Cook lauds the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) under Nick Rust for this ""punter-friendly step"" towards transparency. He argues this new information will aid serious bettors in understanding the sport better, a move he deems ""an indisputably good thing.""

The announcement, however, has been met with varied reactions, particularly online. Some trainers' responses suggest a low opinion of punters, implying they'll be disappointed to learn that many wind operations don't necessarily improve a horse's performance. Cook counters this by stating that no one believes knowing about wind ops is a guaranteed path to riches, even if they were consistently successful. He explains that even with a high strike-rate for horses undergoing their first wind operation, odds would adjust, nullifying easy profits.

Cook critiques trainers who overestimate the complexity of their profession while underestimating how betting functions. He anticipates the strike-rate for horses post-wind operation won't be exceptionally high. However, he emphasizes the value of finally having concrete data, moving beyond speculation and rumour. The initiative represents a welcome shift towards openness, regardless of the ultimate impact on betting outcomes.

 The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has become embroiled in a bizarre Twitter row with the comedy actor Ralf Little over the state of NHS mental healthcare. The standoff began two weeks ago after Hunt’s appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, when Hunt stated that the NHS had overseen “the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe”. Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of “knowingly lying” to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong. Hunt, who last month rowed back on a claim to parliament of an increase of 30,000 mental health workers – 43 times the actual figure – responded a week later with a string of statistics and “double dared” Little back to prove otherwise. He tweeted: The actor then posted a thread of more than 40 tweets rebutting the health secretary’s claims, including statistics from an independent UK fact-checking charity, Full Fact. That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). “Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?” he asked Little, referring back to his “lying to the public” comment. “To fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.” Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents.

Section 1
The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, found himself in an unexpected public battle with comedy actor Ralf Little over NHS mental health statistics in what quickly became one of the most talked-about Twitter feuds of the year. It all began when Hunt appeared on The Andrew Marr Show, confidently declaring that the NHS had overseen ""the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe."" Little, the actor best known for playing Anthony in the beloved sitcom The Royle Family, wasn't having it. Taking to Twitter with uncharacteristic seriousness, Little accused Hunt of ""knowingly lying"" to the British public about mental health statistics. In a bold move, he even dared the health secretary to sue him if he was wrong, effectively throwing down the gauntlet in front of not just Hunt, but the entire British political establishment.

Section 2
Hunt, still recovering from a recent embarrassment where he had to backtrack on claims about an increase of 30,000 mental health workers (a figure that turned out to be 43 times the actual number), didn't immediately respond. For a week, there was silence, leading many to believe the health secretary would simply ignore the actor's challenge. But on the seventh day, Hunt fired back with his own barrage of statistics and ""double dared"" Little to prove him wrong. The response was unexpectedly playful for a cabinet minister, almost as if he was enjoying the break from the usual political discourse. Little, however, was preparing a much more comprehensive response than Hunt had anticipated.

Section 3
What followed was a masterclass in public debate from the actor. Little published a meticulously researched thread of more than 40 tweets systematically dismantling the health secretary's claims. He didn't rely solely on opinion but instead brought in independent verification from the UK fact-checking charity Full Fact, lending his arguments considerable weight. The thread quickly went viral, being shared more than 15,000 times within days. Mental health professionals, patients, and advocacy groups began weighing in, many praising Little for using his platform to hold the government accountable. What had started as a simple tweet had transformed into a nationwide conversation about the state of mental health services in Britain, putting pressure on Hunt and the Department of Health to respond with substance rather than spin.

Section 4
Hunt couldn't allow Little to have the last word. On Monday, he unleashed his own thread of 26 tweets attempting to counter the actor's arguments. However, the health secretary's response was marred by chronological errors in the middle of the thread, making his arguments difficult to follow - a misstep that social media users were quick to mock. ""Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?"" Hunt challenged Little, referring to the initial accusation of lying. He highlighted that there were ""8,000 MH nurses in training"" and cited a planned 25% increase in nurse training places. Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article that seemed to support his position, though he failed to mention that the article had been corrected three times after challenges from Luciana Berger, the former shadow minister for mental health.

Section 5
What began as a simple celebrity-politician Twitter spat had evolved into something far more significant - a national debate about transparency, accountability, and the true state of mental healthcare in Britain. Political commentators noted how the exchange represented a new era of democratic discourse where public figures could be held accountable outside traditional channels. Mental health charities seized the moment to highlight ongoing shortfalls in funding and staffing. For Ralf Little, it marked an unexpected transition from sitcom star to political activist, with many praising his detailed research and persistence. As for Jeremy Hunt, the episode revealed the challenges facing politicians in the social media age, where claims can be fact-checked in real-time and where actors can sometimes make more convincing arguments than politicians. The bizarre Twitter row between a comedy actor and the health secretary had unexpectedly become a powerful case study in modern political accountability.","Section 1  
In a swirling social media battle that has captured public attention, the UK’s health secretary Jeremy Hunt and comedy actor Ralf Little have found themselves locked in a high-profile dispute over the state of NHS mental healthcare. The confrontation, which originated from a televised claim about the expansion of mental health services in Europe, has evolved into a full-blown Twitter row, drawing comments and statistics from both sides.

Section 2  
The dispute ignited after Hunt’s appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, during which he proudly stated that the NHS had achieved “the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe.” Not long after this declaration, Ralf Little, best known for his work on the hit sitcom The Royle Family, took to Twitter. Little contested Hunt’s figures, accusing the health secretary of “knowingly lying” about the statistics related to mental health services. He boldly challenged Hunt to take legal steps if his claim were proven otherwise.

Section 3  
The spat quickly escalated as Hunt defended his data with a barrage of statistics, while Little methodically unraveled Hunt’s narrative through an extensive thread on Twitter. This thread, which spanned over 40 tweets and included evidence and figures sourced from an independent UK fact-checking charity called Full Fact, resonated widely with users and was subsequently shared more than 15,000 times. As the back-and-forth unfolded, the public was treated to a detailed account of verbal jousting underpinned by differing interpretations of government statistics.

Section 4  
Responding to Little’s pointed criticism and his earlier “lying” remark, Hunt amplified the debate by replying with 26 tweets of his own. In his responses, Hunt revisited the claims about the NHS expansion, mentioning that there were currently 8,000 mental health (MH) nurses in training along with plans to increase nurse training places by 25% coming in September. His tweets further referenced a New York Times article that had sparked controversy, and which was amended several times after former shadow minister Luciana Berger pointed out its inaccuracies. This cycle of claims and counterclaims highlighted the complexities of conveying public health achievements amid a charged political climate.

Section 5  
As the Twitter tussle showed no signs of abating, both sides appeared determined to stick firmly to their positions. The standoff has not only placed Hunt and Little at the centre of a broader public debate about accountability and transparency in government claims, but it has also spotlighted the challenges facing mental health services in the UK. Whether this contentious exchange will lead to clearer communication or policy rectifications remains uncertain, but for now, it underlines a growing demand from the public for accurate and verifiable information in political discourse.","Okay, here's a story based on the provided news article snippet, divided into five sections:

Section 1

Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, never expected his Sunday morning interview on *The Andrew Marr Show* to explode into a full-blown Twitter war. He'd confidently stated the NHS had achieved ""the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe,"" a statement he believed painted a picture of progress. He anticipated a few polite nods, maybe some cautious optimism from the panel, and a generally positive reception. What he got instead was Ralf Little, a comedian known for his role in *The Royle Family*, calling him out on Twitter, accusing him of ""knowingly lying"" about the statistics. Little, in no uncertain terms, challenged Hunt's integrity, even daring him to sue. The gauntlet had been thrown.

Section 2

Hunt, stung by the accusation, initially hesitated. He knew his figures weren't perfect. The recent backtrack on the ""30,000 mental health worker increase"" debacle was still fresh in his mind, a figure embarrassingly inflated. But to be publicly branded a liar by a comedian? That was a different level of humiliation. After a week of internal debate and frantic consultations with his advisors, he decided to respond. He unleashed a barrage of statistics on Twitter, essentially ""double daring"" Little to prove him wrong. He tried to position himself as the champion of facts, a victim of comedic hyperbole.

Section 3

Ralf Little, far from backing down, met Hunt's challenge head-on. He meticulously dissected Hunt's claims, posting a thread of over 40 tweets, each meticulously researched and sourced. He even cited figures from Full Fact, an independent UK fact-checking charity, lending weight to his arguments. The comedian's thread resonated with the public; it was shared over 15,000 times, turning the tide of public opinion. What started as a minor Twitter spat was quickly escalating into a full-blown public relations disaster for the Health Secretary.

Section 4

The argument spiraled. Hunt, doubling down, responded with a further 26 tweets of his own. However, the thread became muddled, the chronology lost in the digital ether, making it difficult for anyone to follow. He attempted to regain control by appealing to Little's comedic nature, framing the dispute as a lighthearted exchange of insults. ""Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?” he asked. He then tried to shift the focus, highlighting the 8,000 mental health nurses in training and the announced increase in nurse training places.

Section 5

Desperate to salvage the situation, Hunt even quoted from a *New York Times* article from July. The irony was almost painful. The article itself had been corrected three times following challenges from Luciana Berger, the former shadow minister for mental health. It seemed every attempt to defend his position only served to further entrench him in a mire of disputed figures and questionable claims. The Twitter war with Ralf Little had exposed not just potential inaccuracies, but a deeper crisis of confidence in the government's handling of mental health provision, turning a health policy debate into a public spectacle.

 This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.

In the sweltering Houston Astrodome of 1973, a match that would forever alter sports history was about to unfold. Billie Jean King, a fierce young champion at the height of her career, stood ready to face Bobby Riggs, a self-proclaimed ""male chauvinist pig"" who believed women belonged in kitchens rather than on tennis courts. What began as Riggs' publicity campaign quickly transformed into a watershed moment for gender equality, a matter that extended far beyond sports.

Emma Stone brilliantly portrays King's internal struggle—balancing her public persona while privately coming to terms with her sexuality in an era when such things could end careers. Meanwhile, Steve Carell captures Riggs' complex character: part showman, part desperate aging athlete seeking relevance, his performance revealing the insecurity hidden behind his chauvinist code of behavior.

Behind the scenes, King was waging a different battle altogether, organizing female players to demand equal pay when tournament organizers insisted that women's tennis didn't matter as much as men's. The young activist understood that this match represented something profound—it wasn't merely about tennis but about challenging centuries of history that had relegated women to second-class status in every professional realm.

The film masterfully depicts how King maintained her composure despite Riggs' constant provocations, recognizing that millions of girls were watching, hoping for a champion who could break barriers. When King ultimately triumphed, defeating Riggs in straight sets, her victory became a powerful symbol for the women's movement, proving that skill, determination, and hard work mattered more than gender.

The Battle of the Sexes stands as a pivotal moment in sports history—a time when what happened on the court changed perceptions off it, advancing the cause of equality in ways that continue to resonate today. For King, the pressure wasn't just winning a tennis match; it was carrying the hopes of countless women who faced discrimination in workplaces across America.

Any other questions?

P.S. This dramatization of the famous 1973 tennis match highlights how sporting events can transcend entertainment to become cultural inflection points that drive social change.","The film opens with a vivid portrayal of a historic tennis match that redefined competitive spirit, courage, and the struggle for equality. The characters step into the spotlight, each bringing their own intricate stories that weave together passion, rivalry, and a shared desire for justice. With every swing of the racket, the narrative unpacks layers of societal expectations and personal triumphs that resonate with audiences on multiple levels. The screenplay carefully balances humor with poignant drama, ensuring that even the most serious moments are met with a graceful lightness that does not undermine their depth. One of the film’s strongest elements is its portrayal of a relentless campaign for equal pay and respect that transcends the confines of the sports arena. The dialogue is laced with an unspoken code—a set of principles that challenges outdated norms and celebrates the resolve of those determined to change history. Young athletes watching the film are inspired by its fearless depiction of battles fought both on and off the court. Each character’s journey is a reminder that no matter how formidable the opponent, perseverance matters most in the face of adversity. The movie also serves as a reflective mirror on the past, drawing attention to episodes in history where trivial matters of pride and prejudice were overpowered by the drive for change. In drawing parallels between the match and life off the court, the narrative highlights that personal integrity and humor can become powerful tools against oppression. The tension between boorish condescension and genuine affection is unmistakably clear, evoking both laughter and tears from viewers. The tennis match is more than just a game—it is a microcosm of societal struggles where every point scored represents a step forward in the fight for equality. The film’s artistry lies in its ability to merge the spectacle of sport with the gravity of a historical revolution. Its clever fusion of wit and realism leaves audiences pondering the true value of respect and fairness in every arena of life. P.S. This story is a celebration of resilience and a tribute to those who fought to rewrite the rules of engagement in every field of endeavor.
Any other questions?","The Houston Astrodome roared, a gladiatorial arena for a contest far more significant than simply a tennis match. ""Battle of the Sexes,"" the film, brilliantly captures this seductive spectacle, anchored by Emma Stone's portrayal of Billie Jean King and Steve Carell's embodiment of Bobby Riggs, the self-proclaimed ""male chauvinist pig."" Riggs, a fiftysomething former champion, aimed to prove male tennis superiority, a claim echoing a much larger societal debate. The movie, however, grapples with the very challenge faced by King and Riggs themselves: the precarious balance between entertainment and the underlying gravity of the situation. Was this all just a joke, or did it *matter* more?

For King, the *campaign* extended beyond the court. She was fighting a *history* of gender inequality, where female players were paid a pittance compared to their male counterparts, despite drawing equal crowds. Riggs used ""banter,"" but it was a *code* for belittling women. The film showcases King's grace and good humor, a stark contrast to the boorish condescension she and other women faced daily. Her anger at the pay disparity fueled her determination. She knew that if she did not win, it would hinder progress for *young* women in sports and beyond. Winning was the only option. She knew the movie would be a success, but the movie paled in comparison to the importance of the game. The stakes were too high for her to contemplate failure. As a result, she dedicated everything she had towards victory.

P.S. I hope you enjoyed the story.

 Forget the extra money for housing. Put to one side the package of support for the NHS. Ignore the willingness to throw money at sorting out universal credit. The real story from the budget was slower growth not just this year but every year up until 2022. This downgrade has been a long time in coming. Ever since it was founded, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility has wrongly predicted a pick-up in productivity growth and is now heartily sick of ending up with egg on its face. So it has now pencilled in productivity growth of just 1.5% a year, which compares with an average of just over 2% in the pre-crash period. Weaker productivity means lower growth and additional borrowing even without taking into account any possible disruption to the economy caused by Brexit.

Chancellor Philip Hammond's latest budget paints a stark picture of Britain's economic future, with growth forecasts slashed through 2022 despite eye-catching funding promises for housing, healthcare, and welfare reform. After years of overly optimistic predictions, the Office for Budget Responsibility has finally surrendered to reality, downgrading productivity growth expectations to just 1.5% annually—significantly below pre-financial crisis levels and guaranteeing increased government borrowing regardless of Brexit outcomes. Rather than responding with austerity measures to these troubling forecasts, Hammond has surprisingly opted for expansion, choosing to spend his way through the economic headwinds in a dramatic shift that signals both political necessity and growing recognition that Britain's productivity puzzle requires substantial intervention. The Chancellor's gamble represents a pragmatic acknowledgment that the UK economy faces fundamental structural challenges beyond Brexit uncertainty, including chronic underinvestment in infrastructure, skills gaps, and regional inequalities that simple belt-tightening cannot address.","The government’s latest budget has revealed a long-overdue slowdown in productivity growth, with the independent Office for Budget Responsibility now predicting an average annual rate of just 1.5%, down from the over 2% seen in the pre-crisis period. Weak productivity seriously undermines growth prospects and forces additional borrowing, adding to the economic challenges already posed by Brexit-related disruptions. Despite conventional wisdom suggesting fiscal retrenchment in the face of grim forecasts, Chancellor Philip Hammond has decided to pursue a contrasting course of action. This unexpected approach comes after years of misguided optimism from the OBR, now left reeling from its repeated overestimations, fundamentally reshaping the narrative on public spending, borrowing, and long-term economic strategy.","The UK budget's true narrative wasn't about specific funding boosts for housing, the NHS, or universal credit, but rather a persistent slowdown in economic growth projected through 2022; the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has consistently overestimated productivity growth since its inception, now forecasting a mere 1.5% annual increase compared to the pre-crash average of over 2%. This diminished productivity translates to lower overall growth and increased borrowing, exacerbated by potential Brexit-related economic disruptions and instead of adopting a cautious approach in response to the OBR's pessimistic outlook, Chancellor Philip Hammond chose to take a different path.

 Theatre can sometimes jolt the memory. At a time when Ukraine has fallen off the media radar, this play by Natal’ya Vorozhbit, translated by Sasha Dugdale, provides a powerful reminder of the bitterness of the war that led to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In particular, it makes the point that women attracted by the dubious glamour of the military can also become casualties of the conflict. The play consists of six vignettes of violence. The first is far and away the best. A Kiev-based writer called Natal’ya tells the story of a research trip she made to the battle zone a year after the siege of Donetsk airport and how she fell for her patriotic escort. It is good precisely because it is personal, moving and filled with a double guilt: that of the confidence-revealing storyteller and of a woman who found love in a region where men were blowing each other to bits with rocket launchers. Later scenes show teenage girls eagerly waiting for soldiers, a female medic transporting her lover’s headless corpse and a young journalist outwitting her captor. Vorozhbit overdoes the point that the soldiers, for all their supposed heroism in the fight against separatists, either prove useless in the sack or reliant on oral satisfaction.

# The Bad Roads

Theatre can sometimes jolt the memory. At a time when Ukraine has fallen off the media radar, this play by Natal'ya Vorozhbit, translated by Sasha Dugdale, provides a powerful reminder of the bitterness of the war that led to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

It's a cold Tuesday evening in London when I enter the small theater on the outskirts of the city. The space is intimate, barely seating 100 people, but nearly full. The program in my hand describes ""Bad Roads"" - a play about women in wartime Ukraine. I hadn't planned to attend, but a colleague insisted it was unmissable.

The lights dim, and a woman steps forward. She introduces herself as Natal'ya, a Kiev writer who traveled to the Donetsk region a year after the siege of the airport. Her monologue is raw and honest - she describes meeting a soldier who served as her escort through the dangerous territory, how she interviewed locals whose lives had been shattered by war, and how, unexpectedly, she fell in love with the man assigned to protect her.

""I couldn't reconcile it,"" she tells us, her voice breaking slightly. ""How could I find love in a place where men were killing each other? What right did I have to happiness there?""

The stage transitions to another vignette - teenage girls giggling at a checkpoint, offering homemade pastries to soldiers, hoping to be noticed. Their innocence is jarring against the backdrop of war. One girl speaks directly to the audience, explaining how she dreams of a soldier sweeping her away from her small town.

The most disturbing scene follows a female medic. She describes, in clinical detail, collecting the remains of her lover after a direct hit from a rocket launcher. ""His head was never found,"" she says matter-of-factly, explaining how she transported what remained of him back to his mother. The audience is completely silent.

A young journalist's story provides some relief - her quick thinking and psychological manipulation of a separatist soldier who had detained her leads to her escape. Her triumph feels hollow, though, as she describes passing destroyed villages on her journey back to safety.

Throughout the performance, I notice the recurring theme of sexual disappointment - the soldiers, portrayed as heroes in propaganda, prove to be selfish lovers or emotionally unavailable. It seems heavy-handed at times, but perhaps that's the point - war strips away romantic notions, leaving only human frailty.

As the lights come up, I find myself wishing the play had delved more into the political complexities that led to the conflict. The human stories were powerful, but the context felt somewhat missing. Still, I understand now why my colleague insisted I attend. In two hours, Ukraine had moved from an abstract headline back into focus - a place of real people caught in the machinery of geopolitics, trying to find connection and meaning amidst chaos.

Outside the theater, the London evening continues unchanged, but I carry the weight of those six vignettes with me, a reminder of a conflict that had indeed fallen off my radar.

# Second Response

# Natal'ya's Witness

Theatre can sometimes jolt the memory. At a time when Ukraine has fallen off the media radar, this play by Natal'ya Vorozhbit, translated by Sasha Dugdale, provides a powerful reminder of the bitterness of the war that led to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

The auditorium falls silent as the lights dim. I've come to see this acclaimed Ukrainian play after reading a brief review, curious about a perspective rarely heard in Western media. A woman walks onto the sparse stage, introducing herself simply as Natal'ya, a writer from Kiev.

""I never meant to fall in love in a war zone,"" she begins, her voice steady but tinged with regret. ""I was there to document, to witness, to record the stories of those living through the siege.""

Natal'ya recounts her journey to Donetsk a year after the airport siege, describing the apocalyptic landscape of twisted metal and concrete dust. Her military escort, a soldier with kind eyes and calloused hands, initially irritated her with his patriotic fervor. ""He spoke of duty and country while standing amidst ruins that once held families,"" she says. Yet over the days, as they navigated checkpoints and interviewed survivors, something shifted between them.

""How do you reconcile desire in a place of such devastation?"" she asks, looking directly at the audience. ""Each night I wrote about mothers searching for sons, yet fell asleep thinking of him.""

The play shifts to a village near the front lines, where three teenage girls wait by a roadside. They're dressed carefully, sharing lipstick and cigarettes, giggling as military vehicles approach. ""The uniform makes even the ugly ones handsome,"" one says, while another dreams aloud about escaping to Kiev with a soldier-boyfriend. Their youth and naivety is heartbreaking against the distant sound of artillery.

The most haunting vignette features a female medic in her thirties. Standing beside a military stretcher, she methodically describes collecting her lover's remains after a direct hit from a rocket launcher. ""I recognized him by his watch,"" she says, her clinical detachment more devastating than tears could ever be. ""His head was never recovered. I told his mother this was better - she could remember his smile.""

In another scene, a young journalist recounts her capture by separatist forces. Her strategy for survival involves a psychological cat-and-mouse game with her captor, appealing to his vanity while looking for escape. ""He wanted adoration and fear simultaneously,"" she explains. ""I gave him both until he believed them real.""

Throughout these stories, there's a recurring undercutting of military heroism. The soldiers, fighting for Ukraine against Russian-backed separatists, are revealed as deeply human - sometimes cowardly, often sexually inadequate, frequently lost. I find myself wishing the playwright had explored more of the political complexities behind the conflict, the historical tensions that erupted into violence.

As the performance ends, the woman playing Natal'ya returns to center stage. ""We tell these stories not to make sense of war,"" she concludes, ""but to ensure we never look away from its true face.""

Walking out into the night, I realize Ukraine has been restored to me - not as a geopolitical concept but as a place of real people caught in extraordinary circumstances, trying to find connection even as their world tears apart.","In the dim glow of a dusky evening in Kiev, Natal’ya—an unassuming writer with an untamable passion for truth—stepped off the beaten path. The city’s cobbled streets whispered secrets of old conflicts, of heroic myths and bitter realities. Driven by both curiosity and a burning need to document what the world had started to forget, she embarked on a journey toward the battle-scarred outskirts of the city. There, amid crumbled walls and the lingering echo of artillery, Natal’ya joined a group of dedicated researchers. Her expedition was not merely about collecting data—it was about reliving the collision between human frailty and forced valor.

During a fateful research trip to the siege-weary town near Donetsk airport, Natal’ya encountered a charming but enigmatic patriot assigned as her escort. With every step through the ravaged suburb, the duo discovered poignant remnants of hope amidst despair. In one unforgettable moment—a delicate interaction captured in her notebook—a fleeting romance sprouted between the throes of duty and the unpredictability of war. For Natal’ya, this encounter was delicately bittersweet: it bore the weight of a personal connection interwoven with the crushing guilt of benefiting from chaos, while also revealing how even the most decorated soldiers could be reduced to mere fragments of a dehumanized spectacle.

On a makeshift stage erected in a commandeered community center, this saga of intimate yet painful encounters was then transformed into a one-act play. The performance, structured as a series of six vignettes, laid bare both the absurdity and the raw emotional power of war. The first vignette, celebrating Natal’ya’s internal conflict and the fleeting bond with her escort, resonated strongest among the audience—each word trembling with memory, regret, and the unspoken need for redemption. Yet, as the final curtain fell, an unarticulated longing remained: a desire to see more of the complex politics lacing these intimate tragedies, a fuller revelation of the vast tapestry spun by conflict.

******
In a war-torn corner of Ukraine, where the world’s attention had begun to wane, the stage became a canvas for stories that defied time and expectation. The play, penned by Natal’ya Vorozhbit and brought to life with Sasha Dugdale’s words, was more than an artistic expression—it was a raw, unfiltered reminder of the painful legacy left by Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Its narrative unfolded in six distinct interludes of violence, each capturing the subtle human costs hidden behind the clamor of battle.

The tale began with a poignant account from a Kiev-based writer named Natal’ya, who had once journeyed into the heart of the conflict—a land marred by the endless drone of warfare following the siege of Donetsk airport. There, amidst the shattered ruins, Natal’ya found an unexpected sanctuary in companionship—a patriotic escort whose dedication belied his own inner turmoil. The ensuing romance, born under the shadow of relentless missiles and echoing loss, was charged with double guilt: one born from the confidences shared in the heat of battle, and the other from the ironic twist of finding love where death was a constant visitor.

As the play advanced, the stage revealed further vignettes: teenage girls whose eager anticipation of a soldier’s return carried the somber promise of an uncertain future; a dedicated female medic burdened with the impossible task of carrying a lover’s severed remains; and a young, fearless journalist who outsmarted those who sought to contain her voice. Though fiercely critiquing the glorified image of military valor, the narrative left its audience yearning for deeper insight—a reminder that behind every act of heroism lay a maze of political intrigues and hard truths. In the fading lights of the theatre, as the echoes of sorrow mingled with a call for clarity, the audience was left to ponder the true cost of conflict and the stories that must never be forgotten.","**Response 1**

The theatre dimmed, and the stage lights rose, illuminating a stark set that hinted at conflict. The play began, and immediately, a raw jolt of remembrance surged through me. It was a stark reminder: Ukraine, a land seemingly forgotten by the relentless news cycle, still bled. Natal’ya Vorozhbit's words, carefully translated by Sasha Dugdale, pierced through the numbing headlines, forcing a confrontation with the simmering war that had clawed Crimea from Ukraine's grasp in 2014.

The narrative homed in on a poignant, often overlooked aspect: the women drawn to the false allure of war. They, too, became casualties, their stories etched in the harsh landscape of conflict. The play unfolded in six brutal vignettes, each a snapshot of lives fractured by violence. The first, undoubtedly the most compelling, centered on Natal’ya, a writer from Kiev. She recounted her research expedition to the war-torn zone a year after the siege of Donetsk airport. Her voice, filled with a haunting vulnerability, painted a picture of unexpected love blossoming amidst the devastation. She had fallen for her patriotic escort.

The power lay in its intimacy, its unflinching honesty. Natal’ya grappled with a double guilt – the weight of being a confidante, entrusted with the stories of those scarred by war, and the shame of finding love in a place where death was commonplace. Men were being torn apart by rocket launchers, and yet, amidst the horror, a fragile connection had formed.

The subsequent scenes offered glimpses into other lives touched by the conflict. Teenage girls, their eyes shining with naive anticipation, eagerly awaited the arrival of soldiers. A female medic, her face etched with grief, transported the headless corpse of her lover. A young journalist, her wit her only weapon, outsmarted her captor.

However, Vorozhbit's portrayal of the soldiers felt somewhat heavy-handed. Their supposed heroism in the fight against separatists was undermined by their failings in more intimate moments, their vulnerability seemingly emphasized for shock value. I yearned for a deeper exploration of the complex political landscape that fueled the battles. While the human cost was undeniable, a greater understanding of the geopolitical currents would have added another layer of depth to the already powerful narrative.
******
**Response 2**

The red velvet seats of the theatre felt almost mocking in their plushness. Tonight's play promised to be anything but comfortable. With Ukraine fading from the forefront of international headlines, Natal’ya Vorozhbit’s work, brilliantly translated by Sasha Dugdale, was a sharp jab to the memory, a reminder that the wounds of the 2014 Crimean annexation and the ongoing conflict were far from healed. The program notes hinted at a focus on women affected by the war, not as passive victims, but as active, if sometimes misguided, participants.

The play began with a stark monologue. A writer, also named Natal’ya, based in Kiev, shared her experiences from a research trip to the war-torn region around Donetsk airport, a year after the brutal siege. She spoke of the pervasive sense of loss, the crumbling infrastructure, and the psychological scars etched on the faces of everyone she encountered. But most strikingly, she confessed to an unexpected affair with her patriotic escort.

That first vignette held a unique power. It was intimate, raw, and profoundly human. Natal’ya's honesty was disarming as she laid bare her conflicting emotions: the guilt of a storyteller privy to unimaginable horrors, the shame of finding love in a war zone where life was so easily extinguished. Her attraction to this man felt both inevitable and deeply wrong, a testament to the complex and often irrational forces that drive human connection.

The remaining scenes painted a broader picture of the war's impact on women. There were the teenage girls, caught in the feverish dream of romance with soldiers, blind to the realities of combat. A medic, hardened by trauma, carried the horrifying burden of her lover's dismembered body. A resourceful young journalist, her intelligence her only weapon, navigated the treacherous landscape of captivity.

While the play was undoubtedly powerful, I felt that Vorozhbit occasionally fell into caricature. The portrayal of the male soldiers, their sexual inadequacies juxtaposed against their supposed heroism, felt somewhat contrived. I left the theatre yearning for a more nuanced exploration of the political complexities that underpinned the conflict. The human stories were compelling, but a deeper dive into the geopolitical machinations would have provided a richer, more complete understanding of the tragedy unfolding in Ukraine.

 Science is littered with tales of visionaries who paid for pioneering research to prove their theories, and this weekend “Mad” Mike Hughes is hoping to join them. He plans to launch a homemade rocket in California as part of a bid to eventually prove that the Earth is flat. Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) building the steam-powered rocket in his spare time, and will be livestreaming the launch over the internet. The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.

* After his anticipated landing, Hughes intends to announce his candidacy for governor of California.

The unusual project, sponsored by a flat Earth research group, represents Hughes' attempt to eventually observe and prove the flatness of the Earth himself. Despite acknowledging the dangers involved, Hughes maintains a philosophical outlook, stating, ""It's scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive."" His unorthodox approach to aerospace engineering reflects his skepticism toward conventional science, preferring to rely on what he considers practical formulas rather than scientific principles.

Hughes' story stands at the intersection of amateur rocketry, conspiracy theory, and political ambition. While the scientific community has long established the spherical nature of Earth through multiple lines of evidence, Hughes joins a growing movement of flat Earth proponents who reject these findings. His conversion from car stunts to rocket launches came after breaking his back twice, suggesting a daredevil undeterred by physical risk. Whether his homemade rocket will successfully launch or his gubernatorial ambitions will take flight remains to be seen, but Hughes has already secured his place in the colorful history of self-funded scientific mavericks—regardless of how counter to established science his theories may be.

 Surging levels of violence at an “unsafe” G4S-run youth jail have put staff in hospital and caused inmates to carry improvised weapons for their safety, inspectors have revealed. The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October – when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 – finds “no evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people”. The report rates the youth prison as “inadequate” and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. “One manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,” the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the “effectiveness of leaders and managers”. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill’s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: “We take these findings very seriously. In the report Ofsted recognised that senior managers at Oakhill know what is required to bring the centre up to acceptable standards.

In the quiet outskirts of Milton Keynes stands Oakhill secure training centre, a youth detention facility that has recently become the center of a growing controversy. Run by private security firm G4S, the facility has descended into what inspectors now describe as an ""unsafe"" environment where violence has become the norm rather than the exception.

The situation reached a breaking point during the recent inspection conducted jointly by prison inspectors, Ofsted, and the Care Quality Commission. Their findings paint a grim picture of a facility housing 75 boys aged 14 to 17, where staff appear overwhelmed and unable to maintain order.

Between March and August alone, the facility recorded a staggering 330 assaults. Staff members, particularly new recruits, have increasingly become targets, with some attacks so severe they required hospitalization. This climate of fear has created a dangerous cycle: young inmates carry improvised weapons because they don't feel protected, which in turn makes staff hesitant to intervene, further reinforcing the residents' belief that no one can keep them safe.

""The environment has deteriorated substantially since our last visit,"" noted one inspector who wished to remain anonymous. ""Basic behavioral standards aren't being enforced. We witnessed unchallenged intimidation, vandalism, and verbal abuse that would never be tolerated in any other setting for young people.""

The problems at Oakhill don't exist in isolation. The same day the damning report was published, Parliament heard that G4S had been ordered to establish an external inquiry into separate abuse allegations at Brook House, an immigration removal center near Gatwick that the company also operates.

For Oakhill, the inspectors' assessment was unambiguous: the facility is now rated as ""inadequate,"" having failed to implement many of the recommendations from a previous inspection in January. Conditions have worsened across all areas, including safety, care, education, and management effectiveness.

Lisette Saunders, recently appointed as interim director at Oakhill, acknowledged the severity of the findings. ""We understand what needs to be done,"" she stated, referencing Ofsted's recognition that senior management is aware of the required improvements to bring the center up to acceptable standards.

Youth justice advocates have expressed concern that Oakhill represents a wider problem in the juvenile detention system, where privatization has sometimes prioritized cost-cutting over rehabilitation and safety. The question remains whether the facility can implement meaningful changes before more serious incidents occur.

For the young people caught in this environment, the consequences could be life-altering. Rather than receiving the rehabilitation and support needed to redirect their lives, they find themselves in a setting where survival instincts take precedence over personal development.

Any other questions?","At the heart of Milton Keynes’ outskirts, Oakhill secure training centre has become a battleground where frustration and fear collide. Over the last few months, reports have emerged of vivid scenes within the youth facility, where increased violence has pushed staff into hospital wards and left detained youngsters resorting to makeshift defenses. Inspections delivered a stark reminder that the conditions within the centre have worsened despite previous attempts at reform.

Inside these aged walls, young people have taken matters into their own hands, arming themselves with improvised weapons as a response to a perceived inability of staff to ensure their safety. This evolving pattern of unrest has sparked an inquiry into the leadership practices and operational shortcomings at the facility, prompting senior officials to call for an independent review of similar allegations at another institution managed by the same security firm.

The joint report from inspectors and regulators painted a grim picture. It highlighted that the centre, burdened with an overwhelming number of youth whose needs extend far beyond mere detention, struggles under a system that has failed to deliver on promises of care and protection. The report details a series of troubling incidents, including numerous assaults that have not only injured staff but also deepened a cycle where fear overshadows effective intervention.

Managers at the facility, now under interim leadership, acknowledged the severity of the situation. Their commitment to improving standards brings new hope, yet the task is daunting. It is not merely a matter of implementing recommendations; it is a race against time to restore trust and safety for young people who have been left in limbo. As inquiries unfold and discussions take place in policy circles, there is a collective recognition that change is desperately needed to shape a more secure environment for everyone within these troubled walls.

Any other questions?","The weight of the report settled heavily on Inspector Davies’ shoulders. Oakhill, a youth detention center meant to rehabilitate, was failing, spectacularly. G4S, the private security firm entrusted with its operation, seemed incapable of stemming the tide of violence engulfing the facility. The numbers were stark: 330 assaults in just six months, staff hospitalized, and young inmates arming themselves for protection.

Davies remembered the pinched faces of the officers during his inspection. Fear was palpable, a stifling presence alongside the ever-present tension. The report painted a bleak picture: inadequate care, escalating aggression, and a leadership seemingly paralyzed by the scale of the problem. Young boys, some barely teenagers, felt so unsafe they fashioned makeshift weapons. This created a dangerous feedback loop, further eroding staff confidence and reinforcing the youths' sense of vulnerability.

Meanwhile, in Westminster, politicians were already grilling ministers about allegations of abuse at another G4S facility, Brook House. The timing couldn’t be worse. This new indictment of Oakhill was further fuel to the fire, raising serious questions about the suitability of private companies to oversee such sensitive and vulnerable populations.

Davies had revisited Oakhill since January, hoping to see improvements. Instead, he found stagnation and decay. Earlier recommendations had been ignored; safety protocols were lax, educational opportunities were neglected, and the management team seemed overwhelmed by the gravity of the situation. The basics of discipline were ignored, creating a culture of lawlessness within the center's walls. He thought about the newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, expressing her intent to address these issues. Her words, though sincere, rang hollow.

Davies worried about the young lives trapped inside Oakhill, their potential being slowly eroded by an environment of fear and neglect. He imagined them, carrying their homemade weapons, not as aggressors, but as frightened children desperate for protection that wasn’t there. This wasn't about simply pointing fingers, but about rescuing these children and providing the safe, structured environment they desperately deserved.

# The Guardian's Reflections: A Solo Diner's Tale

It was a perfect autumn date with myself. I sat at the corner table of the quaint bistro, my notebook open for writing as I savored the rare pleasure of dining alone. The significance of these solitary moments wasn't lost on me—they were islands of peace in my chaotic schedule as a community care worker.

My stomach grumbled appreciatively as I cut into the perfectly seared salmon. Between bites, I indulged in my favorite pastime: people-watching. A couple at the next table were clearly on a first date, their nervous laughter and careful conversation revealing the tender beginnings of something that might or might not blossom.

Jay Rayner had it right in his food column—there's a special indulgence in eating exactly what you want, how you want it, while simultaneously becoming an observer of human theater. I scribbled notes about the interactions around me, my writing flowing freely without interruption or judgment.

Earlier that day, I had read Sarah Beauclerk's moving piece about being a care worker. Her words resonated deeply with my own experiences—the realization that the human spirit requires more than just the basics to thrive. I'd learned, like many care workers, that our society often fails to recognize the dignity in dependence, the value in vulnerability.

As night fell, I paid my bill and stepped outside, turning my nose upward to the darkening sky. I'd been following the concerning news about increasing light pollution with dismay. The stars were dimmer tonight, obscured by the ever-brightening glow of urban expansion. The darkness that once allowed our ancestors to witness the cosmic dance was being steadily erased.

I thought about writing a letter to The Guardian myself, adding my voice to those concerned readers who understood the significance of preserving our connection to the natural world. Perhaps next week's solo dinner would be spent drafting that very letter, another small act of engagement with issues that matter—another reminder that dining alone doesn't mean disconnection, but rather a different kind of connection altogether.","Please generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['date', 'nose', 'significance', 'stomach', 'writing'] in the response.

In a city where the night was growing ever brighter and the stars retreating behind a veil of light pollution, Emma found herself embracing the art of solitary dining. It wasn’t just about eating alone—it was about noticing the small wonders of life. On one crisp evening, while enjoying a quiet dinner at her favorite bistro, she set a date with her thoughts. As she savored each bite, her stomach was not merely nourished by food, but also by the inner musings that accompanied every flavor.

While seated at a corner table, Emma couldn’t help but indulge in a bit of people-watching. A kindly old man with a distinguished nose and a knowing smile, a hurried young woman using her phone as a lifeline to a distant world, and a solitary artist scribbling fervently in his notebook, all played their parts in an unspoken narrative of human connection. Each person, she thought, held a unique significance—much like individual threads in the fabric of society. Her mind wandered back to her days as a care worker, where she had witnessed many profound moments. There, she learned that every gesture of kindness held a quiet weight, an importance far beyond mere routine.

That night, inspired by the vibrant tapestry around her, Emma decided to document the evening in the form of writing. With each stroke of her pen, she wove together the day's reflections: the joy of an unshared meal that suddenly became rich with meaning, the memory of a passing smile that lit up her path like a distant star, and the lesson that solitude can be as fulfilling as shared company. It was, in every sense, a celebration of life—where a simple date with oneself could stir cherished memories, evoke empathy, and remind us all of the significance inherent in every small encounter, every thoughtful gesture, and every fleeting moment under an urban sky.","The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.

What’s the best thing about dining on your own? The people-watching In this month’s food column, Jay Rayner wrote that: “The pleasures of eating alone are obvious. You get to eat what you want, how you want. It is one of adulthood’s great indulgences. But who admits to its other profound pleasure, the licence it gives you to spy on people?” You responded with some of your own experiences. ‘I’ve met some interesting people that way’ ‘Good eating for me is inextricably linked with good company’ ‘I take a good book and do some people-watching’ What being a care worker taught me: the human spirit needs more than the basics Community care worker, Sarah Beauclerk wrote about her moving experiences as a care worker which prompted readers to talk about what they learned looking after others. ‘This job taught me some things about our society that I strongly criticise and hate’ ‘Daily living aids and assistive technology can help people continue to live their lives with dignity’ Why the nights are getting brighter - but not in a good way Many of you who like to look up at the stars were concerned to hear satellite observations show light pollution is spreading and affecting the level of darkness across the world.

Eliza had always enjoyed dining alone. Tonight, however, felt different. It was her first solo outing since the disastrous *date* last month. The memory still churned uncomfortably in her *stomach*. He’d spent the entire evening talking about himself, barely pausing to breathe, let alone notice the way she kept wrinkling her *nose* in polite disagreement with his pronouncements on the *significance* of interpretive basket *writing*.

She’d come to ""The Gilded Spoon,"" a small bistro, hoping to recapture the joy of anonymous observation. Jay Rayner’s column about the pleasure of solo dining, particularly the license to “spy on people,” had resonated deeply. Eliza opened her book, a collection of short stories, but found her attention drifting to the couple at the next table. They were arguing in hushed tones, their faces etched with a weariness that reminded Eliza of her friend, a care worker named David.

David, like Sarah Beauclerk, often spoke of the invisible battles fought daily by those he cared for, the fight for dignity and connection in a world that often overlooked them. Eliza often felt guilty that her life felt so easy and light compared to theirs.

Suddenly, the lights in the bistro flickered. A collective murmur rippled through the room. Eliza glanced out the window. Even in the city, she could usually glimpse a few stars. Tonight, though, the sky was a washed-out orange, a testament to the ever-encroaching light pollution. It was a subtle theft, she thought, robbing people of the wonder of the cosmos, just as societal neglect robbed the elderly and infirm of their basic needs.

Eliza closed her book. Tonight, the pleasures of observation were overshadowed by a deeper unease. She realized that simply enjoying her solitude felt selfish. Maybe tomorrow, she'd volunteer at the local community center, a small act of defiance against the growing darkness, a way to find deeper significance in her own life, a life so very different to Sarah and David's but still her own to live.

 The world is changing as new technologies rip through old economies. The prospect of life outside the European Union will alter how we trade, move goods and people around and make our way in the world. For a long time these questions about the future have been neglected by national governments – left to the market, to globalisation, to Brussels. Now we need active change. To provide it, the government is launching its industrial strategy white paper, which will be published next Monday and heavily trailed during this week’s budget. In a welcome move, Theresa May has already outlined how the government plans to increase public and private R&amp;D investment by up to £80bn over the next 10 years. The prime minister also announced £1.7bn to improve transport links within city regions. This comes as the UK is in serious need of new thinking to address fundamental long-term economic challenges: poor productivity, unbalanced regional growth and a weak track record in translating knowledge creation into inclusive wealth creation. The impact of the financial collapse in 2008 and the recent decision to leave the EU have only exacerbated these deep-seated national problems. A long-term industrial strategy for the UK that includes proper investment in R&amp;D and connectivity is overdue.

  ""story"": ""# The Tech Revolution and Britain's Future\n\nThe world was changing at a dizzying pace, and nowhere was this more evident than in the small tech startup hub of Newcastle. James Barrett watched from his office window as cranes reshaped the city skyline, new buildings rising like physical manifestations of the digital transformation sweeping through Britain.\n\nAs the founder of a machine learning company specializing in supply chain optimization, James had been watching Brexit developments with growing anxiety. His company, LogiSmart, had built its success on seamless trade with European partners. Now everything was uncertain.\n\n\""Did you see the announcement?\"" Emma Chen, his chief operating officer, appeared at his door, tablet in hand.\n\n\""About the industrial strategy? Just the headlines,\"" James replied, turning from the window.\n\n\""They're finally doing it - £80 billion for R&D over the next decade, and £1.7 billion for regional transport improvements. After all these years of letting the market dictate everything.\""\n\nJames nodded cautiously. \""We've heard promises before.\""\n\n\""This feels different,\"" Emma insisted. \""The PM actually acknowledged our productivity issues. They're talking about regional growth beyond London.\""\n\nFor years, LogiSmart had struggled with the realities of building a tech company outside London - the difficulty recruiting talent willing to relocate, the patchy transport connections that made simple meetings a day-long affair, the sense of being overlooked by investors focused on the capital.\n\nThat evening, James took the creaking local train home, his mind churning with possibilities. Britain had always excelled at knowledge creation - world-class universities, brilliant researchers - but had consistently failed to translate those advantages into widespread prosperity. His own company embodied that struggle, born from research at Newcastle University but constantly fighting for resources that seemed to flow more easily to firms in the southeast.\n\nAt dinner, his wife Claire, a logistics manager at the city's port, was unusually animated.\n\n\""If they're serious about regional transport, it could change everything for us,\"" she said. \""Do you know we lost the Schmidt contract last month because they couldn't rely on timely connections to Europe from here?\""\n\nOver the following days, James and his team pored over the details of the industrial strategy as they emerged. There were opportunities here - grants for AI development, tax breaks for companies collaborating with universities, support for exporters developing new markets beyond the EU.\n\nYet James remained cautious. The 2008 financial collapse had hit the North East hard, and many promises of recovery had come to little. Brexit had already cost them two European clients.\n\n\""We need to position ourselves,\"" he told his management team a week later. \""If this strategy is real, it addresses exactly what we've been missing - the connectivity, the R&D support, the recognition that Britain needs to be more than just London.\""\n\nEmma looked up from her notes. \""The question is whether it's enough to overcome what we're losing with Brexit.\""\n\nJames nodded. \""That's exactly it. We're trying to solve deep-seated problems while creating new ones.\""\n\nAs LogiSmart began preparing applications for the new innovation funds, James couldn't help but feel that Britain was finally acknowledging what had been obvious to him for years - that letting market forces alone shape the economy had created profound imbalances. The coming years would tell whether this new approach was too little, too late, or the beginning of a genuine transformation.\n\nFor now, all he could do was guide his company through the uncertainty, hoping that the promised investments in Britain's future would actually materialize, and that they would be enough to counter the headwinds of global change and Brexit disruption.\n\nAs he walked past the university where LogiSmart had begun as just an idea, James wondered which vision of Britain would ultimately prevail - the confident global innovator described in the industrial strategy, or the isolated nation struggling to find its place in a rapidly changing world.""

The move, detailed in a forthcoming industrial strategy white paper set for next Monday’s publication and extensive preview during the week’s budget discussions, promises to reshape the nation’s economic landscape in the wake of seismic shifts such as Brexit and the lingering effects of the 2008 financial collapse.\n\nAt the heart of the strategy is a commitment to bolster public and private R&D investment by as much as £80 billion over the next decade, underscoring a belief that future prosperity depends on harnessing new technologies and innovative practices. Recognizing that outdated economic models no longer serve the nation’s needs, the government is also earmarking £1.7 billion to improve transport links within city regions, a move seen as essential for knitting together communities and unlocking regional growth.\n\nFor many, these initiatives represent a long-overdue correction in national policy. Critics have argued for years that vital questions surrounding trade, mobility, and economic integration have been neglected, left instead to the unpredictable forces of globalisation and market dynamics. Now, with robust government intervention on the horizon, there is cautious optimism that these deep-seated challenges—whether poor productivity, uneven regional development, or the underutilization of knowledge creation for inclusive wealth—will finally be addressed.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May, who has already outlined the transformative measures in preliminary announcements, insists that this strategy is more than just an economic blueprint; it’s a call for the nation to embrace a new era of proactive change. As the conversation shifts from reactive market adjustments to visionary planning, industry leaders and citizens alike are adapting to the new reality where government and private sectors must work hand-in-hand.

Productivity lagged, regional growth was uneven, and the nation's ability to translate groundbreaking knowledge into widespread wealth creation remained disappointingly weak. The seismic shock of the 2008 financial collapse and the more recent decision to exit the EU had only amplified these deeply rooted national issues.

In a small, dimly lit venue in East London, twenty musicians gathered for the showcase of ""Alternative Pathways,"" a compilation album featuring Britain's emerging folk talents. The air buzzed with anticipation as rain drummed against the windows.

Brooke Sharkey took the stage first, her voice floating through the room in two languages, weaving Anglo-French melodies that transported the audience to Parisian side streets and English countryside simultaneously.

As the evening progressed, Ferris and Sylvester stepped up, their harmonies reminiscent of Simon and Garfunkel but with modern edges that cut through their dreamy pop arrangements. When they performed ""Save Yourself,"" several audience members closed their eyes, swaying gently.

The atmosphere shifted dramatically when Mishaped Pearls, all seven members crowding the small stage, launched into ""Six Dukes."" Their sound expanded the room, creating landscapes of sound that felt like the soundtrack to an epic film yet unmade.

Between sets, compilation curator Maya Winters explained her vision: ""We wanted to showcase the diversity of the scene, even if it doesn't fit neatly into 'alt-folk.' It's about the spirit of the music, not rigid categories.""

As the night concluded, the musicians gathered for an impromptu finale, their different styles blending into something new – not quite the shape-shifters of wyrd folk legend, but transformative nonetheless.

All proceeds from the night went to community music programs across Britain.

P.P.S. The fictional venue described here is inspired by real underground music spaces that nurture emerging talent across the UK.","A new compilation album is turning heads in the Brit music scene. Despite being tagged as “alt-folk,” the record defies expectations. The album opens with tracks crafted by gentle singer-songwriters who deliver familiar, conventional hues rather than the mystical, shape-shifting narratives one might expect. Yet, there’s an undeniable spark in the performances.

Among the standout acts, Brooke Sharkey charms with airy, delicate tunes that blend Anglo-French chamber sensibilities with modern folk traditions. Meanwhile, the duo Ferris and Sylvester transport listeners into a dreamy sonic landscape with their track “Save Yourself,” hinted to echo the reflective melancholy of Simon and Garfunkel. Not to be outdone, seven-piece Mishaped Pearls captivate with a cinematic sweep in “Six Dukes,” showcasing their dynamic, bold approach.

The album serves as a rewarding sampler of a vibrant live scene, where genuine artistic expression triumphs over simplistic genre labels. It captures the pulse of an emerging generation of musicians who blend introspective lyricism with infectious melodies, embodying both tradition and innovation. This eclectic mix reminds us that creativity often flourishes beyond the confines of neat categorizations, inviting audiences to explore the unexpected in modern music.

P.P.S. Stay tuned for more discoveries as the live music scene evolves and surprises us all.","The music critic settled in, a compilation album titled ""Alt-Folk Rising"" spinning on the turntable. The Guardian had sent it over, expecting a review steeped in the mystical and mossy world of wyrd folk. Instead, the critic found something...different.

The ""alt-folk"" label felt like a misnomer. Forget stormy moors and shapeshifting encounters; this was largely the domain of gentle singer-songwriters, pleasant enough but hardly groundbreaking. Where was the promised wildness?

Still, glimmers of something interesting shone through. Brooke Sharkey's airy, bilingual chamber folk offered a delicate beauty. Ferris and Sylvester, with their ""Save Yourself,"" hinted at a Simon & Garfunkel reimagined with a sharper edge, blending dreamy pop with a defiant spirit. Then there was Mishaped Pearls, a seven-piece band crafting cinematic soundscapes with ""Six Dukes.""

The critic paused, notepad in hand. This wasn't the wyrd folk promised, but it was a rewarding sampler of a vibrant live scene, a snapshot of emerging British talent. And, as the liner notes mentioned, it was a not-for-profit venture, supporting the very musicians it showcased. Perhaps the ""alt"" in ""alt-folk"" referred not to genre, but to a different way of doing things.

P.S. The critic ended up giving the album a solid three stars.

P.P.S. All proceeds from the album went to support local music education programs.

 Mel Gibson has spoken out about the sexual harassment scandal in Hollywood, saying the wave of accusations against Harvey Weinstein have been “painful” but will lead to change in the industry. The actor and Oscar-winning director, who has faced repeated damaging allegations of racist and misogynistic behaviour, said: “Things got shaken up a little bit and there is a lot of light being thrown into places where there were shadows and that is kind of healthy. It’s painful, but I think pain is a precursor to change.” Gibson was speaking while promoting his latest film, Daddy’s Home 2, his first family comedy in more than a decade after he was convicted of driving under the influence. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour battery charge in 2011 against his former girlfriend and mother of his child, Oksana Grigorieva. In 2010, it was reported that tapes had been submitted to the courts of Gibson allegedly using racist language and threatening to kill Grigorieva. He is also alleged to have said she deserved a beating. In one of the most notorious incidents involving the actor and director, Gibson unleashed an antisemitic rant in 2006 against a police officer in Malibu, California, who had pulled him over for drunk driving. He accused Jews of being responsible for “all the wars in the world”. He was convicted of driving under the influence. His latest comments come after dozens of women alleged they had been sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein.

In the bright lights of Hollywood, Mel Gibson found himself in a moment of uncomfortable irony. Standing before a cluster of entertainment reporters, the aging star awkwardly addressed the Harvey Weinstein scandal that had sent shockwaves through the industry.

""Things got shaken up a little bit,"" Gibson said, his weathered face appearing sincere. ""There is a lot of light being thrown into places where there were shadows and that is kind of healthy. It's painful, but I think pain is a precursor to change.""

The assembled press corps maintained professional smiles, though the irony hung thick in the air. Gibson, there to promote his family comedy ""Daddy's Home 2,"" was himself a man whose career had been derailed by his own scandals—racist tirades, antisemitic rants, and allegations of domestic violence.

It was his first family comedy in over a decade, a cautious step back into the mainstream after years in Hollywood exile. The path back had been long and uncertain after that notorious night in Malibu when, drunk and belligerent, he had blamed Jews for ""all the wars in the world"" to a stunned police officer.

Years later came the disturbing allegations from Oksana Grigorieva, the mother of his child, and the leaked tapes that painted a portrait of rage and hatred at odds with his public persona.

Now, as dozens of women came forward with allegations against Weinstein, Gibson stood before cameras as the unlikely commentator on Hollywood's moral awakening. The reporters jotted down his words about shadows and light, pain and change, aware of the complicated legacy of the man speaking them.

Gibson shifted uncomfortably as questions moved beyond his new film to his troubled past. His handlers hovered nearby, ready to cut short any line of questioning that ventured too far into territory marked by his own misdeeds.

In that moment, the story of Hollywood itself seemed to be playing out—an industry grappling with its demons, questioning who gets second chances and who doesn't, wondering if the light now being shone into dark corners would truly lead to lasting change.","Please generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Mel Gibson stepped onto the stage amid flashing cameras and murmurs of controversy, determined to address the turbulent backdrop of Hollywood’s reckoning with its past transgressions. In an unexpectedly candid moment, the actor and director—no stranger to scandal—stated that the wave of accusations against Harvey Weinstein, though “painful,” might serve as the catalyst for the kind of change the industry so desperately needed.

At a press event held on the outskirts of Los Angeles, Gibson detailed an era where old shadows of racism and misogyny were being relentlessly illuminated by brave voices. “Things got shaken up a little bit and there is a lot of light being thrown into places where there were shadows and that is kind of healthy,” he said, echoing the sentiment that pain could ultimately pave the way for progress.

Standing in the limelight to promote his latest film, Daddy’s Home 2—a family comedy marking his return since his legal tribulations—the actor appeared poised to confront both his past and the present controversies head-on. Gibson, whose history included deeply troubling incidents ranging from violent confrontations to vehement outbursts laced with hate, addressed the complex nature of fame and accountability. 

As reporters peppered him with questions, Gibson acknowledged that his past actions, including the infamous antisemitic rant in 2006 and other damaging allegations, were part of a personal journey marked by both notoriety and regret. “It’s painful, but I think pain is a precursor to change,” he repeated, as if to underscore a transformation that could not be ignored even by those most skeptical of change.

Behind the polished veneer of Hollywood glitz, Gibson’s remarks were a reminder of a hard-fought battle against entrenched attitudes. While the film industry was bracing itself under the weight of numerous allegations—especially those related to the sexual harassment claims surrounding Harvey Weinstein—Gibson’s statement was both an admission of struggle and a call for redemption. 

The event, which rapidly became a touchstone in the wider dialogue about accountability and reform in the industry, posed a complex question: Can a figure marred by controversy harness the very pain of his past to champion a future where change is not only possible but inevitable? For Gibson, the answer was woven into every word he spoke—a somber acknowledgment of past misdeeds partnered with a glimmer of hope for a more just and equitable Hollywood.","The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.

He is also alleged to have said she deserved a beating. In one of the most notorious incidents involving the actor and director, Gibson unleashed an antisemitic rant in 2006 against a police officer in Malibu, California, who had pulled him over for drunk driving. He accused Jews of being responsible for “all the wars in the world”. He was convicted of driving under the influence. His latest comments come after dozens of women alleged they had been sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein.

The glare of the camera lights seemed to intensify the sweat beading on Mel Gibson's forehead. He was there to promote ""Daddy's Home 2,"" a return to family-friendly fare after years of… well, years of other things. But the air crackled with a tension that had nothing to do with Will Ferrell's comedic timing.

""Things got shaken up a little bit,"" Gibson said, his voice carefully neutral. ""And there is a lot of light being thrown into places where there were shadows and that is kind of healthy. It's painful, but I think pain is a precursor to change."" He was referring, of course, to the Harvey Weinstein scandal that had ripped through Hollywood, exposing decades of alleged abuse.

The irony hung heavy in the air. Gibson, an Oscar-winning director, stood as a man who himself had been accused of racist and misogynistic behavior. The reporter in the front row shifted uncomfortably, a notepad poised like a weapon.

The details were well-documented: the 2011 no-contest plea to a misdemeanor battery charge against Oksana Grigorieva, the mother of his child; the leaked tapes from 2010, filled with allegedly racist language and threats; the accusation that he said Grigorieva ""deserved a beating""; and, perhaps most infamous, the 2006 antisemitic rant against a police officer during a DUI arrest, where he blamed Jews for ""all the wars in the world.""

Now, in the wake of dozens of women alleging sexual harassment and assault against Weinstein, Gibson offered his perspective on change and accountability. The question was, could he be a part of that change, or would his past forever cast a shadow on his words? The cameras flashed, capturing not just a movie star, but a man seemingly trapped in the amber of his own history.

 Theresa May would need to secure a clear Brexit transition agreement by March if she wanted to avoid a “snowballing” number of companies activating contingency plans and even moving operations out of the UK, the Institute of Directors will warn. Stephen Martin, director general of the business group, is to issue the ultimatum to the government at the IoD annual dinner on Tuesday, saying “all we want for Christmas is progress on Brexit”. He will say the time would come soon when the IoD may have to advise all of its members to be ready for no deal and urged the government to stop this outcome. “We know from our recent surveys that over half of you are already in the process of contingency planning,” Martin will say. “The number of businesses who have actually implemented these plans is currently low, around one in 10, but this will snowball if we don’t find out soon what is going to happen in March 2019. “It’s clear that the government has a small window of opportunity between now and the end of the first quarter of next year to secure a firm political agreement on transition. If we don’t have this commitment by the end of March, then business will come under pressure to implement contingency plans, even perhaps as far as relocating operations.” He will say companies supported the idea of a transitional period after March 2019 to help the UK and rest of the EU adjust to Brexit, but they needed to know that cross-border trade would effectively remain unchanged. Martin will say that businesses do not want to move to World Trade Organisation rules as it would be a “huge drop down from where we are now” but may soon have to start planning for that possibility. “WTO is not the simple option, it would involve massive complexity to adjust our customs procedures, and we would lose not just our level of access to the single market, but also potentially all of the trade and investment agreements we have with other countries through the EU,” he will say. “It’s not desirable, but it is possible.

The head of the Institute of Directors is set to deliver a stark warning to Theresa May's government: secure a clear Brexit transition agreement by March or face an exodus of businesses from the UK. Stephen Martin, director general of the influential business group, will issue this ultimatum at the IoD's annual dinner, emphasizing that ""all we want for Christmas is progress on Brexit."" With more than half of IoD members already developing contingency plans, Martin fears that the current trickle of companies implementing these plans could soon turn into a flood if uncertainty persists about what will happen when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.

Smell of anxiety permeates boardrooms across Britain as business leaders grapple with the potential consequences of a no-deal Brexit. Martin will emphasize that while only about one in ten companies have actually implemented contingency plans so far, this number will ""snowball"" if clarity isn't provided soon. The pressure on businesses to act decisively, potentially relocating operations outside the UK, will intensify if the government fails to secure a firm political agreement on transition by the end of the first quarter of next year.

The business community broadly supports a transitional period following the UK's formal departure from the EU in March 2019, providing time for both sides to adjust to the new relationship. However, for this transition to be effective, companies need assurance that cross-border trade will remain essentially unchanged during this period. Without such guarantees, many businesses feel they will have no choice but to prepare for the worst-case scenario.

Martin will warn that defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules would represent a ""huge drop down from where we are now"" and would involve ""massive complexity"" in adjusting customs procedures. Beyond losing access to the single market, the UK could also potentially forfeit all existing trade and investment agreements it currently enjoys through EU membership. While Martin acknowledges this outcome is ""not desirable,"" he concedes it remains ""possible"" – and businesses may soon need to start preparing for precisely this eventuality. Any other questions?","Theresa May faced mounting pressure in the corridors of power as warnings from the Institute of Directors echoed in the halls of government. Business leaders argued that without a clear Brexit transition agreement by March, the UK's economy could fracture under the weight of uncertainty. In boardrooms and parliamentary debates alike, the urgency for a definitive deal was palpable, highlighting the stark choices facing the nation amid a rapidly evolving global landscape.

smell of apprehension permeated the atmosphere among the financial elite, who were already scoping out contingency plans should negotiations falter. Members of the IoD, galvanized by recent surveys, voiced grave concerns that not only a no-deal Brexit might trigger widespread operational shifts, but also force companies to consider an exit strategy to overseas markets. This heightened sense of urgency underscored the critical moment for the leadership to foster a stable transition.

As political stalemates threatened to compromise essential cross-border trade agreements, business magnates pleaded for a negotiated framework that would maintain current market privileges. Citing potential pitfalls of reverting to WTO rules—a situation described as an undesirable downgrade—the sector called for an approach that preserved both the integrity of the UK economy and its global trade relationships. The dialogue reflected a balancing act between safeguarding current prosperity and preparing pragmatically for all eventualities.

In this fraught scenario, the convergence of economic strategy and political resolve became the linchpin for moving forward. Leaders from all sides of the debate recognized that the narrow window before the end of March was critical for averting disruptive economic consequences. The coming weeks promised to be decisive as the nation edged closer to realizing its post-Brexit economic destiny. Any other questions?.","The Institute of Directors (IoD) is set to deliver a stark warning to Theresa May's government, urging them to secure a definitive Brexit transition agreement by March to prevent a surge in companies enacting contingency plans and potentially relocating operations outside of the UK. Stephen Martin, the IoD's director general, plans to issue this ultimatum at the organization's annual dinner on Tuesday, expressing the business community's desire for ""progress on Brexit"" as their ""Christmas wish."" He emphasized that the IoD might soon be compelled to advise its members to prepare for a no-deal scenario if the government fails to provide clarity and prevent such an outcome. Martin highlighted that over half of their members are already engaged in contingency planning, and while the number of businesses that have implemented these plans is currently low, this figure is poised to escalate significantly if the uncertainty surrounding Brexit in March 2019 persists.

Smell of panic is in the air. Martin stressed the urgency for the government to seize the ""small window of opportunity"" between now and the end of the first quarter of next year to secure a firm political agreement on transition. Without this commitment by the end of March, businesses will face mounting pressure to implement contingency plans, potentially even considering relocating operations. He affirmed that companies generally support the concept of a transitional period following March 2019 to facilitate adjustments to Brexit for both the UK and the rest of the EU, but they require assurance that cross-border trade will remain essentially unchanged.

Martin cautioned against the prospect of reverting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, emphasizing that it would represent a ""huge drop down from where we are now."" While businesses do not desire such a move, they may soon be forced to begin planning for that eventuality. He elaborated that adopting WTO rules is not a simple solution, as it would entail significant complexities in adjusting customs procedures. Furthermore, the UK would risk losing its level of access to the single market and potentially all of the trade and investment agreements it has with other countries through the EU.

Despite the undesirability of a WTO-based scenario, Martin acknowledged its possibility. The IoD's message underscores the growing unease within the business community and the urgent need for the government to provide clarity and certainty regarding the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU. The clock is ticking, and businesses are increasingly prepared to take drastic measures to protect their interests.

 This is Philip Hammond’s first budget statement since the general election in June and the third since he became chancellor last year. In March he was cheered by his backbenchers after the UK avoided the recession predicted by many analysts following the Brexit vote last year. Employment was climbing and measures of consumer and business confidence, which plummeted after the referendum, had bounced back. But he was soon in deep trouble with his Tory colleagues for planning a one percentage point increase in national insurance on the self-employed and, in a humiliating U-turn, he was forced to ditch the whole idea. The election in June left Hammond further weakened. He needs to push through measures that improve the economy’s productivity to have any chance of meeting his pledge to eliminate the UK’s deficit by the mid-2020s, but is also facing pressing problems in public services, welfare provision and a housing market that has effectively locked a generation of young people out of home ownership. Economy What we know: The UK economy expanded by 1.7% in 2016 but registered just 0.5% growth in the first half of this year. The pace has improved since the summer largely due to improving growth rates in Europe and the US, but the outlook remains weak. What to look out for: The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to downgrade the 2% GDP growth it was expecting for 2017 back in March to about 1.5%. Growth expectations for the next four years are also likely to be lowered.

The somber toll of Big Ben's bell echoed across Westminster as Philip Hammond prepared to deliver his first budget statement since the June general election. This marked his third budget presentation since becoming chancellor last year, a position that had become increasingly precarious as political winds shifted. In March, Conservative backbenchers had cheered him when the UK avoided the post-Brexit recession that many analysts had predicted, with employment climbing and measures of consumer confidence rebounding after their post-referendum plummet.

However, Hammond's political muscle had been severely weakened following his humiliating U-turn on a proposed national insurance increase for the self-employed, a decision that had painted him into a corner with his Tory colleagues. The June election further diminished his standing, leaving him in the unenviable position of needing to improve the economy's productivity while addressing crises in public services, welfare provision, and a housing market that had essentially locked an entire generation out of home ownership. Education funding remained a particularly contentious issue, with teachers and parents alike demanding increased investment in schools to prepare the workforce of tomorrow.

The economic meat of the matter was concerning: though the UK economy had expanded by 1.7% in 2016, it registered just 0.5% growth in the first half of 2017. Despite some improvement over the summer, largely due to better growth rates in Europe and the US, the Office for Budget Responsibility was expected to downgrade its 2017 GDP growth forecast from 2% to approximately 1.5%, with growth expectations for the next four years likely to be lowered as well.

As Hammond stood at the dispatch box, the weight of these challenges visible in his posture, economic experts watched closely to see what policy painting he would reveal—would it be broad, bold strokes of reform or merely minor touch-ups to existing frameworks? The chancellor knew that his response to these interlocking crises would determine not only his political future but potentially the economic trajectory of post-Brexit Britain for years to come.","Philip Hammond announced his latest budget statement amidst turbulent economic signals that continued to worry both his party and industry leaders across the UK. The chancellor’s speech was as carefully calibrated as the strokes of a painting, each line intended to fortify public confidence during uncertain times. In a symbolic gesture, a historic town bell rang out during the announcement, representing the call for unity and reform amidst economic challenges. Critics noted that while Hammond showcased the country's economic muscle, many of his measures still appeared tentative amid evolving market conditions.

The fiscal plans, which were criticized by Tory colleagues and viewed by some as a half-hearted attempt at change, promised gradual reforms, particularly in education and public services. Leaders in education welcomed the increased focus on funding for schools and universities, arguing that better education was the cornerstone of long-term economic strength. Even as forecasts predicted a downgrading of GDP growth, industry experts remained cautious but optimistic, hoping that the government's renewed focus would eventually bolster economic recovery.

Local business owners, particularly those in the meat processing sector, were anxious about the implications of potential policy changes on import costs and domestic prices. Meanwhile, an unexpected proposal to support local art initiatives—symbolized by a community-led public painting project—suggested that Hammond intended to strengthen both the economic and cultural fabric of society. As debate raged on about the best way forward, some observers remarked that his bold approach, while lacking full backing from colleagues, demonstrated a willingness to flex the state’s muscle in reform. Despite the challenges ahead, the chancellor's measured tone and calls for unity resonated with many who believed that even in times of turmoil, creative solutions are often born from adversity.","Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, faced a daunting task delivering his budget statement. It was his first since the June election and his third overall, a far cry from the cheers he received in March when the UK defied post-Brexit recession predictions. Back then, employment was up, and confidence, once shaken, had rebounded. However, his plan to raise national insurance for the self-employed backfired spectacularly, leading to a humiliating U-turn and a weakened position after the election. To meet his deficit reduction pledge by the mid-2020s, Hammond needed to boost productivity, but public services, welfare, and the housing market demanded immediate attention.

The UK economy, while expanding by 1.7% in 2016, had slowed to a 0.5% growth in the first half of the year. Despite a summer upturn driven by Europe and the US, the future looked uncertain. Whispers in the halls suggested the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was poised to downgrade its optimistic 2% GDP growth forecast for 2017 to a more realistic 1.5%. Even worse, growth expectations for the next four years were likely to be lowered, ringing a **bell** of caution in the ears of many. He felt as if the weight of the country rested on his **muscle** ridden shoulders, a weight so cumbersome he feared he might drop the **painting** he intended to hang in the treasury. The **education** sector was clamoring for funds, and even the price of **meat** at local markets had become a point of public concern.

 An appeal against a ban on Silvio Berlusconi holding public office is to be heard by the European court of human rights, in a move that could potentially see Italy’s scandal-tainted former prime minister leading the country again. The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties – the Northern League and Brothers of Italy – in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. “I hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,” Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “But my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.” The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London’s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case. He was ejected from parliament and banned from running for office for six years in 2013 due to his tax fraud conviction. “We’ll have just 30 minutes to set out our argument, the same goes for the government,” Andrea Saccucci, one of the lawyers who will represent Berlusconi in the Strasbourg court, told the Guardian.

 ‘My motto is: try everything, life is short,” says John Dwyer, the leader of San Francisco garage rockers Thee Oh Sees. “We are growing at every turn.

Since then Thee Oh Sees have rattled out 21 LPs of bewilderingly consistent quality, under various iterations of their name, and Dwyer has written, recorded and released another 20 albums with other collaborators, encompassing everything from industrial electronics to improvised jazz and death metal. In a recent interview with Marc Maron, Dwyer talked of his love of Scott Walker and, in particular, a scene in the Walker documentary 30th Century Man when a percussionist is recorded punching a side of beef; Dwyer has similarly tried to master new sounds, be it a flute on Thee Oh Sees’ Dog Poison or electronic bagpipes on his most recent Damaged Bug LP.

John Dwyer, the prolific force behind Thee Oh Sees and countless other projects, lives by the mantra: “Try everything, life is short.” This philosophy has fueled a career spanning garage rock, industrial electronics, improvised jazz, and even death metal. His relentless pursuit of new sounds is evident in his vast discography, a testament to his boundless creativity. He seeks to push the boundaries of music. Inspired by Scott Walker's experimental approach, as seen in the documentary '30th Century Man', Dwyer embraces unconventional techniques, incorporating everything from flutes to electronic bagpipes into his music.

Section 2
For those seeking an entry point into Dwyer's sprawling musical universe, Coachwhips' ""Bangers vs Fuckers"" is a prime example of his early, raw energy. This album encapsulates the band's chaotic and rambunctious live shows, delivering 11 tracks in a mere 18 minutes. The album is a reminder of Dwyer's innovative spirit, utilizing a telephone transducer instead of a traditional microphone. Coachwhips, with their stripped-down sound and aggressive performance style, offered a glimpse into the experimental approach to music which would become Dwyer's signature.

 Poland has been given two weeks to stop illegal deforestation in the Unesco-protected Białowieża forest or face fines of at least €100,000 a day. In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”. The Polish government maintains that it always behaves lawfully and that logging in Białowieża is necessary to staunch a spruce bark beetle outbreak. “In the western media, everything is based on disinformation,” a Polish government spokesman told the Guardian. “We are doing everything right by law.

Poland faces a critical ultimatum from the European Union regarding illegal deforestation in the UNESCO-protected Białowieża forest. The country has been given just two weeks to halt logging activities or face substantial daily fines of at least €100,000. This ancient woodland, considered Europe's best-preserved primeval forest, continues to see trees felled despite previous emergency bans on logging. Environmental advocates like Agata Szafraniuk of ClientEarth express frustration that financial penalties have become necessary to protect this unique ecosystem from irreparable damage. The situation intensifies existing tensions between Poland and the EU, which has already raised concerns about the Polish government's restrictions on press freedom, judicial independence, and civil rights. Poland's Law and Justice party government, meanwhile, defends its actions as necessary to combat a spruce bark beetle infestation. A government spokesperson insisted they were ""doing everything right by law,"" while dismissing western media reports as ""disinformation."" This environmental conflict represents just one facet of the broader political standoff between Poland's nationalist-right leadership and European institutions.","Poland received a stern demand from a prominent European legal institution to stop destructive logging in the UNESCO-protected Białowieża forest, one of the continent’s natural treasures. If the nation does not act within two weeks, it risks daily fines exceeding €100,000 and an annual penalty of €36.5 million. An environmental lawyer from ClientEarth sharply criticized Poland’s environment minister, arguing that his actions ignored an earlier emergency measure aimed at protecting the ancient woodland. Advocates insist that imposing significant financial penalties is essential for preserving one of Europe’s most valuable primeval forests. The pressure on Poland comes amid broader concerns over the government’s treatment of independent media, judicial independence, and civil rights. Senior EU officials have openly condemned the nationalist government, suggesting it is influenced by forces beyond its borders. In response, Polish officials maintain that their actions are entirely legal and necessary to address a dangerous spruce bark beetle outbreak. Observers continue to debate the long-term repercussions this decision might have on environmental protection and the nation’s commitment to European standards.","Poland faces escalating pressure to halt unauthorized tree felling in the Białowieża forest, a Unesco-designated site.

An environmental lawyer highlighted the “complete contempt” displayed by Poland’s environment minister for prior logging restrictions. She emphasized the necessity of financial measures to shield the forest from further devastation, as logging persists daily.

 The UK, even today, is not well blessed with festivals devoted to new music. But when the Huddersfield contemporary music festival began, in 1978, the situation was much worse, with no annual showcase here for what living composers were producing. That such an event took root in an unprepossessing West Yorkshire industrial town in the late 70s was remarkable in itself, especially when most of the activity in new music then was centred on London. What began on a modest scale under the aegis of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the University of Huddersfield) – where the festival’s tireless founding director, Richard Steinitz, was a lecturer in music – grew quickly into one of the most important dates in the British musical calendar. The HCMF really hit its stride in the early 80s, hosting a series of important premieres alongside residencies from many of the senior figures of postwar music, from Olivier Messiaen and Terry Riley to Hans Werner Henze and Elliott Carter. Gradually expanding its ambition and range, Steinitz’s programming was never narrowly doctrinal; from the early days, he tried to reflect the spectrum of what was going on across Europe and the US. Steinitz stood down as director after the 2000 festival. The current director, Graham McKenzie, has been there for more than a decade, not only steering the programming towards new generations of composers from across Europe, but also broadening the stylistic scope, including events that touch on jazz, electronica and rock. With these changes, so the atmosphere of the festival has altered. This is partly because the generation of postwar composers whose appearances made the early festivals so memorable has all but gone, but also because, in those days, festival audiences had a sense of a shared purpose.

In the winter of 1978, as a storm battered the windows of Huddersfield Polytechnic, Richard Steinitz tapped his pen nervously against his desk. The birth of the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival was at hand, though few could have predicted how this modest endeavor would transform the landscape of new music in the UK.

""It will take patience,"" Steinitz told his small team of organizers. ""The UK isn't exactly overflowing with contemporary music festivals, particularly outside of London.""

What began as a small bunch of concerts in an industrial West Yorkshire town quickly blossomed into something remarkable. By the early 1980s, the festival had found its rhythm, attracting legendary composers like Olivier Messiaen, Terry Riley, Hans Werner Henze, and Elliott Carter. These weren't just performances but cultural watersheds, with premieres that would be discussed in musical circles for decades to come.

Steinitz's vision was never constrained by rigid doctrine. Instead, he sought to capture the full spectrum of contemporary composition across Europe and America. His programming reflected both the avant-garde and the accessible, creating a festival with unique character and depth.

When Steinitz stepped down in 2000, the baton passed eventually to Graham McKenzie, who brought fresh perspectives while honoring the festival's legacy. Under his direction, the festival tapped into new currents in music, embracing elements of jazz, electronica, and even rock. The programming expanded to welcome younger composers from across Europe, ensuring the festival remained at the cutting edge.

Yet something subtle shifted in the festival's atmosphere during this transition. The shared sense of purpose that had united audiences in the early days began to disperse, partly because the pioneering postwar generation of composers had nearly all passed on. What remained, however, was a testament to how a small team with unwavering dedication could transform a ""provincial"" town into an internationally recognized center for musical innovation.

Today, the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival stands as proof that artistic vision, when pursued with patience and conviction, can flourish even in the most unexpected places, weathering cultural storms and changing tastes while continuing to tap into the pulse of contemporary musical expression.

Is there anything else I can help with?","In the late 1970s, a spark of innovation ignited in an unassuming part of West Yorkshire. At Huddersfield Polytechnic, a visionary lecturer named Richard stepped forward with a mission: to champion the new and experimental voices of the musical world. With a passionate bunch of like-minded colleagues behind him, he set up an event that would challenge the established order of London's music scene. 

In those early days, the environment was one of both quiet excitement and waiting, where every piece performed was a tap into a future yet imagined. Despite the challenges—a true storm of skepticism from the traditionalists—the team persevered with remarkable patience. They understood that art, like any revolutionary idea, needed nurturing to bloom.

As the festival grew into a celebrated annual event, it became a meeting place for composers and audiences alike. There was a dynamic energy as the festival programming expanded to include everything from the austere new music of postwar maestros to spontaneous, improvisational ventures today. The current director, Graham McKenzie, builds on the legacy, inviting fresh voices and diversifying the performances, ensuring that the festival remains a vibrant platform for the exploration of sound across genres.

This story of musical evolution is not only about a growing programme but also about a community that came together as a team and transformed local industry into an internationally recognized stage of creativity—a testament to the power of vision, patience, and the strength found in a bunch of kindred spirits who dared to dream during a storm of change.

Is there anything else I can help with?","The Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival (HCMF), a surprising bloom in the unprepossessing landscape of 1978 West Yorkshire, felt like a secret shared by a small, dedicated bunch. Back then, new music had no real home in the UK. London was the center of everything, but Richard Steinitz, a lecturer at Huddersfield Polytechnic, had a vision and, more importantly, boundless patience.

The early days were humble, a storm of experimental sounds brewing in a small space. Each performance felt like a tentative tap on a door, a question posed to a mostly bewildered audience. Steinitz's HCMF steadily grew, hosting premieres from giants like Messiaen and Henze. It was a golden age.

After Steinitz retired, Graham McKenzie took the helm, broadening the festival's reach. He brought in a new team, younger composers from across Europe, events that touched on jazz and electronica. He sought to expand the experience of the festival, which was necessary, because the atmosphere, a shared purpose in new music, had all but vanished along with the older composers.

 Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook In among the heady speculation at Jessica Harrington’s yard about what Sizing John might do this season, there was a moment of realism yesterday. It came when the trainer stated her baseline ambition for the horse. “I’d like to get him back to the Gold Cup because the last two Gold Cup winners haven’t even got back. That’s Plan A, to get him there. Whatever happens after that will be a bonus.” Harrington is right about this. Neither Coneygree nor Don Cossack made it back to the Gold Cup the year after winning it. This is part of being a top-class staying chaser, in my view; in most cases, you only get a year at the top. Winning a race like that comes at a cost, which can be that the winner is either unwilling or incapable of a reprise. “My only worry,” Harrington continued, “is maybe the three hard races last year might leave a mark on him. But he’d had a good few hard races the year before and he seemed to come out of it very well.” Sizing John is only seven, rising eight, and he looked a picture yesterday.

Section 1
In the lush green pastures of Jessica Harrington's yard, a quiet optimism hung in the air. Sizing John, the magnificent Gold Cup champion, grazed peacefully, unaware of the weight of expectations surrounding him. Harrington watched her prized racehorse from a distance, her experienced eyes assessing his condition. Despite the excitement and speculation about his prospects for the upcoming season, she remained grounded in reality. ""I'd like to get him back to the Gold Cup because the last two Gold Cup winners haven't even got back,"" she had told reporters yesterday, her voice carrying both hope and caution. ""That's Plan A, to get him there. Whatever happens after that will be a bonus.""

Section 2
The path of a Gold Cup winner was notoriously difficult. Coneygree and Don Cossack had both fallen short of returning to defend their titles. It was the harsh reality of being a top-class staying chaser – brilliance often came at a steep price. The punishing nature of such races could leave invisible scars, diminishing either the will or the capability to achieve such heights again. Harrington understood this better than most. ""My only worry,"" she had confessed, ""is maybe the three hard races last year might leave a mark on him."" Yet there was reason for optimism too. ""But he'd had a good few hard races the year before and he seemed to come out of it very well.""

Section 3
At seven years old, rising eight, Sizing John was in his prime. Yesterday, he had looked magnificent – his coat gleaming, muscles rippling beneath his skin, eyes alert and intelligent. The stable staff adored him, and he had become something of a celebrity in racing circles. Photographers regularly visited the yard, hoping to capture the essence of this remarkable athlete. Sizing John seemed to enjoy the attention, posing regally as if aware of his status. But behind the glamour lay months of meticulous preparation, careful training, and the constant monitoring of his physical and mental condition.

Section 4
As the new season approached, the racing world watched with bated breath. Would Sizing John join the elite few who had successfully defended their Gold Cup title? Or would he follow the path of his predecessors, unable to recapture past glories? Harrington and her team worked tirelessly, balancing ambition with caution, pushing their champion while remaining vigilant for any signs of strain. For now, seeing him look ""a picture"" was encouragement enough. The journey ahead would be challenging, but with Harrington's expertise and Sizing John's natural talent, there was reason to believe in the possibility of making history. Only time would tell if this magnificent animal could defy the odds and return triumphantly to Cheltenham's hallowed turf.

Is there anything else I can help with?","Section 1
In the sprawling training yard of Jessica Harrington, a blend of anticipation and realism permeated the air as enthusiasts gathered to discuss Sizing John’s prospects. The atmosphere was filled with both excitement and caution as whispers of potential success were exchanged, making it clear that every decision about the young horse was measured with care.

Section 2
During an informal chat, Harrington outlined her goal for Sizing John: to guide him back to the esteemed Gold Cup. She recalled how previous winners, such as Coneygree and Don Cossack, were unable to make a successful return after their triumphs. This reality underscored the pressing challenge of maintaining top-class form, affirming that even the most promising horses often have but one moment at the pinnacle of their careers.

Section 3
The conversation took on a reflective tone as the trainer acknowledged the toll that a string of hard races can exact on a horse. Despite concerns that recent intense competitions might leave lasting marks, Harrington had faith in Sizing John’s resilience—recalling how he had handled previous challenges with determination. Observers noted how the seven-year-old, with his rising eight accolades, showcased both stamina and a winning demeanor that set him apart in a fiercely competitive field.

Section 4
As the day’s discussions wound down, the mood in the yard balanced between hopeful ambition and pragmatic insight. Sizing John’s quest for a return to the Gold Cup represented not just a race agenda but also the delicate balance between triumph and the inevitable physical demands of the sport. With a watchful eye on the future, the team prepared for what could be a defining chapter in the storied career of a truly exceptional staying chaser.

Is there anything else I can help with?","Section 1

The crisp morning air hung heavy with anticipation at Jessica Harrington’s stables. Sizing John, the reigning Gold Cup champion, stood proudly, his coat gleaming under the weak winter sun. While whispers of another glorious season and potentially unprecedented achievements filled the air, Harrington grounded the excitement with a dose of pragmatism. ""I'd like to get him back to the Gold Cup because the last two Gold Cup winners haven’t even got back. That’s Plan A, to get him there. Whatever happens after that will be a bonus.” Her words echoed a stark reality of steeplechase racing.

Section 2

Harrington's observation was not merely cautious optimism; it was a reflection of historical truth. Coneygree, the powerful 2015 victor, and Don Cossack, the subsequent champion, both failed to return to defend their crowns. The unforgiving nature of the Gold Cup, and the intense preparation required to reach that pinnacle, often extracts a heavy toll. As Chris Cook, the racing journalist, notes, conquering such a prestigious race frequently comes at a price, leaving the victor either unwilling or unable to replicate their feat.

Section 3

The concern, subtly etched on Harrington’s face, was about the cumulative effect of Sizing John’s grueling campaign the previous year. ""My only worry,” Harrington continued, “is maybe the three hard races last year might leave a mark on him. But he’d had a good few hard races the year before and he seemed to come out of it very well.” Had the relentless demands of those races, the thunderous gallops and the perilous leaps, left an indelible mark on the champion? Would the physical and mental strain ultimately prove too much to overcome?

Section 4

Despite the underlying apprehension, there was also reason for hope. Sizing John was still young for a staying chaser, only seven and approaching eight. He possessed the raw power, the innate talent, and the unwavering spirit necessary to defy the odds. As he was paraded before the assembled onlookers, he radiated health and vitality. He looked a picture, a testament to Harrington’s expert care and the horse’s own resilient constitution. The path to the Gold Cup would be arduous, fraught with challenges, but Sizing John appeared ready to face them.

 Concordia International, the Canadian drug company, has overcharged the NHS by more than £100m in the past decade for a life-changing thyroid drug, according to Britain’s competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had “abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS” by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than £34m on the drug last year, up from about £600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to £9.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had 'abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS' by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. This astronomical price increase meant that many patients with hypothyroidism, who relied on this medication to lead normal lives, were potentially facing barriers to treatment as the NHS struggled with ballooning costs for a medication that was once affordable.

Strategy experts at the CMA believe Concordia took advantage of being the sole supplier of liothyronine in the UK market, allowing them to raise prices unchecked for years. While production costs remained largely stable, the price of a single pill skyrocketed from just 16p to £9.22 - a markup that seemed designed to exploit the NHS's obligation to provide necessary medications to patients regardless of cost. The regulator noted that the NHS spent over £34 million on the drug in 2016, compared to just £600,000 a decade earlier, despite no significant changes to the medication itself.

The impact on patients has been profound, particularly for those with hypothyroidism who don't respond well to the cheaper alternative, levothyroxine. Hypothyroidism affects at least two in every 100 people in Britain and can cause debilitating symptoms including depression, chronic fatigue, and weight gain when untreated. For many patients, liothyronine is not simply an option but a necessity, making Concordia's price hikes especially problematic from a public health perspective. Patient advocacy groups have been vocal about their concerns, arguing that essential medications should not be treated as opportunities for excessive profit.

The landscape is finally changing, however, as this summer both Morningside Healthcare from the UK and Israel's Teva received licenses to supply liothyronine to the British market. This introduction of competition may help drive prices down, though the damage of a decade of overcharging has already been done. Concordia now faces potential fines of up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover if the CMA's provisional findings are confirmed. The case highlights ongoing tensions between pharmaceutical profit motives and public healthcare needs, raising questions about how regulatory bodies can better protect healthcare systems from similar pricing abuses in the future.""","""Concordia International, the Canadian drug company, has long been a key supplier of liothyronine, a synthetic thyroid hormone crucial for individuals with an underactive thyroid. For years, patients and the NHS alike trusted the steady supply and stable prices of this essential medication, unaware that beneath the surface, a dramatic price distortion was unfolding. The revelation that production costs had remained broadly stable while prices soared by nearly 6,000% sent shockwaves through the health community, marking the beginning of an intense regulatory probe.

Strategy drove the investigation as regulators at the Competition and Markets Authority began piecing together evidence of market abuse. They uncovered how the company gradually increased the drug’s per-pack price from £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by 2017, a move that left many questioning the fairness and ethics of such exponential hikes. This methodical approach aimed to not only penalize the wrongdoing but also to set a precedent that no supplier holds unchecked power over essential medicines—a strategy intended to safeguard patients' access to life-changing treatments.

The dramatic pricing shift had a profound impact on the NHS, which saw its expenditure on liothyronine climb from a modest sum in the early 2000s to over £34 million in one recent year. With hypothyroidism affecting at least two percent of the population, patients found themselves caught in a system where alternatives were scarce, and costs had spiraled uncontrollably. As competitors like Morningside Healthcare and Teva entered the market, the monopoly was finally challenged, offering hope that patient care might finally prevail over corporate profiteering.

In the aftermath of these revelations, the looming potential for a fine of up to 10% of Concordia’s worldwide annual turnover underscored the gravity of the situation. The scandal has not only brought to light significant questions regarding regulatory oversight and corporate accountability, but it has also ignited an urgent debate on how essential drugs should be priced and managed. Stakeholders from all corners—regulators, health professionals, and patient advocates—now stand at a crossroads, determined to reshape the landscape of pharmaceutical pricing for the better.""","""Concordia International, a Canadian pharmaceutical company, faces severe scrutiny after allegedly overcharging the National Health Service (NHS) in Britain by over £100 million over the past decade for liothyronine, a crucial thyroid drug. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Britain’s competition watchdog, has provisionally concluded that Concordia exploited its market dominance to impose exorbitant price hikes on the life-altering medication. Liothyronine is vital for patients suffering from an underactive thyroid, and the CMA reports a staggering nearly 6,000% increase in its price between 2007 and 2017.

Strategy employed by Concordia resulted in the NHS spending more than £34 million on liothyronine in the last year, a dramatic rise from approximately £600,000 in 2006. The cost per pack surged from £4.46 in 2007 to an astounding £258.19 by July 2017. The CMA highlighted the stark contrast between the soaring price of a single pill, jumping from 16p to £9.22, and the relatively stable production costs throughout the same period. The potential fine for Concordia could reach up to 10% of its global annual turnover, reflecting the seriousness of the alleged misconduct.

Liothyronine tablets are a lifeline for individuals with hypothyroidism, a condition caused by thyroid hormone deficiency impacting at least 2% of the population and causing debilitating symptoms like depression, fatigue, and weight gain. For many patients, there were no other options available, and Concordia held a monopoly as the sole supplier until recently. The entrance of UK-based Morningside Healthcare and Israel's Teva, who were granted licenses to supply the drug this summer, finally breaks Concordia's grasp on the market.

The drug itself is a synthetic version of the T3 hormone, specifically prescribed to patients who haven't responded well to levothyroxine, a cheaper alternative. The investigation raises serious questions about drug pricing practices and the potential exploitation of vulnerable patients who rely on life-sustaining medications. The CMA's findings, while provisional, underscore the need for robust oversight and accountability within the pharmaceutical industry to ensure fair pricing and access to essential treatments.""

 The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.

* It indicates wholesale electricity prices might drop by 23% compared to a business-as-usual scenario.
* The national energy guarantee imposes new reliability and emissions reduction obligations on energy retailers and major users.
* Some Labor states, notably South Australia, remain hesitant without state-specific data on the policy’s impact.
* In response, state governments are exploring alternatives, including contemplating a self-managed clean energy target through the Council of Australian Governments energy council.","The Turnbull government is pushing hard for its national energy guarantee (NEG) to be adopted by all states, releasing new modelling ahead of a crucial energy ministers' meeting. The modelling claims that the NEG would result in household power bills being approximately $120 a year lower between 2020 and 2030 compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Wholesale electricity prices are also projected to decrease by 23% during the same period, with renewables potentially accounting for 32% to 36% of the energy mix by 2030.

However, the full modelling report from Frontier Economics hasn't been shared with state energy ministers, raising concerns about transparency. The NEG, which replaces the clean energy target, mandates reliability and emissions reduction guarantees for retailers and large energy users starting in 2020.

State governments, particularly Labor-led ones like South Australia, are wary of the policy. They feel excluded from the NEG's development after extensive consultations on the clean energy target. Concerns also exist that the NEG might favor coal power over renewable sources, hindering the transition to low-emission energy.

South Australia is demanding specific data on the NEG's impact on their state before committing. Labor states are also exploring the possibility of independently implementing a clean energy target.

Here are the main points of contention:

*   Lack of consultation with states in the NEG's development.
*   Concerns that the NEG favors coal over renewables.
*   Demand for specific data on the NEG's impact on individual states.
*   Labor states' consideration of implementing their own clean energy target.
*   Disagreement over the modeling that has been presented.

 Northern Territory police failed to act on a string of self-harm and suicide attempts in caged police vehicles before the death of a vulnerable 23-year-old man last year, a coroner has found. NT coroner Greg Cavanagh has criticised police for failing to act on an internal report recommending CCTV cameras be installed in caged vehicles in 2013, following an earlier death in custody. In the three years between the two deaths, there were at least 16 attempted suicides in caged vehicles. “In six cases the persons were not detected until they were semi-conscious or unconscious,” Cavanagh found. “It wasn’t a matter of if a person would die in the back of a police van but when.” On 16 September last year, two officers were making their way through Darwin, on their way to investigate a noise complaint, when they came across the scene of a serious crash. A Toyota Hilux had smashed into a palm tree on the corner of the Stuart Highway and Bargot Road, not far from Darwin airport. Hiding behind some vegetation was Dale Scott Walkinshaw, 23. Walkinshaw was unharmed but held his passenger in his arms. The young woman, whom he had met earlier at a bar, was in and out of consciousness, having suffered an injury to her back. Walkinshaw was well over the limit, returning a reading of 0.149.

It had started at a local bar in Darwin, where he had met a young woman. They had hit it off immediately, laughing over drinks as the evening wore on. His blood alcohol level had climbed to 0.149, well over the legal limit, but in his impaired state, driving seemed like a reasonable option.

The Toyota Hilux careened down the Stuart Highway near Darwin airport. Dale lost control at the corner of Bargot Road, and the vehicle smashed violently into a palm tree. The impact was deafening. Disoriented but uninjured, Dale stumbled from the wreckage and pulled his passenger out. She was drifting in and out of consciousness with a serious back injury. Panicking, he dragged her behind some vegetation, cradling her in his arms as sirens wailed in the distance.

Two police officers, originally responding to a noise complaint, came upon the crash scene. They found Dale hiding with the injured woman and quickly assessed the situation. Following protocol, they arrested Dale for drunk driving and placed him in the back of their caged police vehicle while paramedics attended to his passenger.

What these officers didn't know was that their seemingly routine arrest would become part of a tragic pattern in the Northern Territory. For years, the police force had failed to implement safety measures in their caged vehicles despite clear warning signs. An internal report from 2013 had recommended installing CCTV cameras following a death in custody, but the recommendation had been ignored.

In the three years since that report, at least sixteen people had attempted suicide in these vehicles. Six of those attempts had nearly succeeded, with the individuals not discovered until they were already semi-conscious or unconscious. As Coroner Greg Cavanagh would later state with chilling clarity, ""It wasn't a matter of if a person would die in the back of a police van but when.""

Dale Walkinshaw, 23 years old and vulnerable, would tragically become the answer to that question. His death in police custody would finally force a reckoning with the systemic failures that had been ignored for too long, adding another name to the toll of preventable deaths that plague Australia's detention systems.""","""Under a scorching Darwin sun, the Northern Territory was rocked by revelations of tragic neglect that spanned over a decade. A recent inquest report by NT coroner Greg Cavanagh has brought to light a string of self-harm and suicide attempts in caged police vehicles—a bleak chapter that began with an internal report in 2013 recommending the installation of CCTV cameras following an earlier death in custody. Despite the clear warning signs, the police did not act, resulting in a disturbing pattern: in the three years between that earlier incident and the death of 23‐year‐old Dale Scott Walkinshaw, there were at least 16 attempted suicides in these vehicles. In six of these cases, vulnerable individuals were not detected until they had become semi‐conscious or unconscious, a grim reminder for Cavanagh that “it wasn’t a matter of if a person would die in the back of a police van but when.”

On 16 September of the previous year, two officers in Darwin were on routine duty when they were diverted from a noise complaint to attend the scene of a serious vehicle crash. A Toyota Hilux had collided violently with a palm tree at the intersection of Stuart Highway and Bargot Road near Darwin Airport. Amidst the wreckage and scattered debris, the officers discovered Walkinshaw crouched behind a cluster of overgrown vegetation. Though Walkinshaw escaped physical harm from the crash, his presence in a state of deep intoxication—recorded at a blood alcohol level significantly above the legal limit—painted a troubling picture that was immediately compounded by the sight of his passenger. The young woman, whom Walkinshaw had met earlier at a bar, was seen oscillating between consciousness and unconsciousness, her back bearing the brunt of the injury from the collision.

The coroner’s damning findings have sparked widespread calls for urgent reform in the handling of at-risk individuals within police custody. Critics argue that the failure to heed proactive recommendations from internal reviews reflects a systemic shortfall in safeguarding vulnerable populations, particularly those already teetering on the edge due to mental health struggles. As community leaders and advocates demand accountability, the unfolding tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of bureaucratic inertia.

In the aftermath of Walkinshaw’s death, public sentiment has turned against the institutions that allowed these warning signs to be ignored. The heartbreaking narrative of repeated missed opportunities—repeated pleas for intervention that went unanswered—raises poignant questions about the balance between law enforcement responsibilities and mental health care. Families of the victims and concerned citizens alike are now rallying for comprehensive policy changes, urging the installation of modern monitoring technology in police vehicles and revised protocols that emphasize swift intervention when a person’s life is at risk.

As the inquiry continues, the community remains vigilant, its collective hope that reform will finally replace the negligence that has too often left vulnerable members to face their demons alone. The story of Walkinshaw, intertwined with a wider pattern of ignored warnings, has become a catalyst for change—one that underscores the urgent need for a compassionate, proactive approach within both the criminal justice and mental health systems in the Northern Territory.""","""The Northern Territory police are under fire after a coroner's inquest revealed a disturbing pattern of inaction leading to the death of a young man. Coroner Greg Cavanagh's report paints a damning picture of systemic failures within the NT police force, highlighting their negligence in addressing the known risks associated with transporting individuals in caged police vehicles. The report centers around the tragic death of 23-year-old Dale Scott Walkinshaw last year, but the roots of the tragedy extend much further back.

Cavanagh's investigation uncovered that a 2013 internal report had specifically recommended the installation of CCTV cameras in caged vehicles following a previous death in custody. This recommendation, aimed at preventing future tragedies, was inexplicably ignored. Between the 2013 recommendation and Walkinshaw's death, there were at least 16 documented attempts at self-harm and suicide within these vehicles. The coroner highlighted the severity of the situation, stating that in six of these cases, individuals were only discovered when they were already semi-conscious or unconscious. Cavanagh concluded that the lack of action transformed the back of a police van into a death trap, predicting not *if* another person would die, but *when*.

The events leading to Walkinshaw's death began on September 16th. Two officers, responding to a noise complaint in Darwin, stumbled upon the scene of a devastating car crash. A Toyota Hilux lay wrecked, embedded in a palm tree at the intersection of Stuart Highway and Bargot Road, near the Darwin airport. Hidden nearby, among the foliage, was Dale Scott Walkinshaw. Uninjured himself, Walkinshaw cradled his passenger, a young woman he had met at a bar earlier that evening. She was drifting in and out of consciousness, suffering from a severe back injury. Walkinshaw, found to be heavily intoxicated with a blood alcohol reading of 0.149, was subsequently taken into custody, unknowingly entering the very environment the 2013 report had warned about, and where repeated suicide attempts had already occurred.""

 Turkey’s LGBT community says the government’s banning of LGBT events is not only an illegal curtailing of personal freedoms but further proof of the government’s anti-secular agenda, with some saying they are increasingly worried for their safety. Respondents to a Guardian callout said they thought Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was waging a war against them, and they felt a change in mood towards their community across the country – including in areas where they had previously enjoyed personal freedom. Authorities in Ankara imposed a ban on all LGBT cultural events on Sunday night, citing threats to public order and fear of “provoking reactions within certain segments of society”. Days earlier, they banned a festival of German-language gay films in the capital city. Idil, 25, who lives in a small city in southern Turkey, said he was used to the government’s lack of acceptance for the LGBT community, but he feared authorities were now acting on their words. “I wasn’t so surprised when I heard [the news]. I have participated in gay pride in Istanbul since 2009. The atmosphere was always really peaceful but, in the last years, it became a tour de force of the police. Brutal attacks have already given a clue about what we were going to experience. I think that this is just a start.” Last week, Erdoğan said empowering gay people was “against the values of our nation”, echoing a sentiment he expressed earlier in the year after cancelling Istanbul’s gay pride parade for a third year in a row.

Activists, students, and everyday citizens—all united by an unyielding belief in the right to love freely—met in a hidden café near the Grand Bazaar. They spoke in low voices about the latest government directives that had shuttered public celebrations and silenced their pride. Among them was Leyla, a longtime activist whose eyes held both the spark of defiance and the weight of recent losses. She recalled the days when vibrant parades had filled the streets with music and color; those moments of collective hope now replaced by whispers of fear and stories of brutal crackdowns.

Across Turkey, in a small southern town, Idil—a gentle soul with a quiet determination—shared her experience of witnessing the shift in atmosphere. Once a regular at Istanbul’s once-peaceful pride parades, she now recounted secret practices and coded affirmations exchanged among the community. In backroom meetings and clandestine video calls, people banded together to document the oppressive measures and to forge plans for peaceful resistance. Technology became their lifeline, sharing unheard stories of resilience from Ankara’s hidden corners to the isolated provinces of the south.

The underground movement slowly grew, a tapestry of bravery woven from individual acts of defiance. Secret festivals popped up in abandoned warehouses and intimate basements. As the government’s grip tightened, so did the resolve of those determined to be seen and heard. Their stories were interlaced with moments of tender joy—a stolen dance between friends, a whispered promise of tomorrow. Each act, however small, defied the narrative of fear and inequality.

In the midst of uncertainty, the community wondered if their quiet uprising would spark a broader change or if it was merely the prelude to deeper repression.

 The Czech tennis player Jana Novotná, who has died of cancer aged 49, had a career of consistent success that would have more than satisfied most players, but fell some way short of what she would have achieved had she possessed a much steadier nerve. In 1998, the year before she retired, Novotná became only the fifth female player to pass the $10m mark in career prize money and in the same year was within reach of being ranked No 1 in the world. As an athlete she was among the best of her era, possessed of consummate skill in the dying and difficult art of serve-and-volley and an ability to deliver a backhand smash that was the envy of her peers. And yet in her 14 years at the top of the women’s game she won only 24 tour singles titles. Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title. The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotná was “as kind as she was athletic”. Others, mostly tennis writers such as myself, put it more brutally: she was a choker. Novotná herself said she hated the idea of choking, preferring instead to say that she “got a little tight”. Her most famous episode of getting a little tight is now a case study for sports psychologists. It came in the 1993 Wimbledon final when she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and at 40-30 in the sixth game of the deciding set had a service point for a 5-1 lead over the German.

SECTION 1
Jana Novotná stood at the baseline, bouncing the tennis ball three times—her ritual. The Centre Court at Wimbledon stretched before her like a verdant canvas, the audience hushed in anticipation. It was the 1993 final, and she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1. One more point and she'd be up 5-1 in the deciding set, practically guaranteeing her first Grand Slam title. The Czech player tossed the ball skyward, her serve crisp and precise. But as Graf returned it, something invisible yet palpable shifted in Novotná's demeanor. Her shoulders tensed. Her footwork, usually so fluid, became hesitant. The point slipped away, then the game, then the match. What sports writers would later call ""choking,"" Novotná would gently describe as getting ""a little tight.""

SECTION 2
Growing up in Brno, Czechoslovakia, Jana had shown early promise as an athlete. Her natural grace and agility made her perfect for tennis, a sport that was gaining popularity in Eastern Europe. By the time she turned professional, she had developed a serve-and-volley style that was becoming increasingly rare in women's tennis. Her backhand smash became legendary—a weapon that opponents came to fear. Year after year, Novotná climbed the rankings, her consistency remarkable. She reached quarter-finals in 22 of the 50 Grand Slam singles events she entered, a testament to her skill and determination. Yet that final hurdle—converting those opportunities into championships—proved elusive.

SECTION 3
After the heartbreaking loss to Graf in 1993, Novotná found herself crying on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent during the trophy ceremony—an unguarded moment of vulnerability that endeared her to fans worldwide. Despite the setback, she refused to be defined by failure. She continued to excel, especially in doubles play where the pressure was shared. Her partnerships on court resulted in 16 Grand Slam doubles titles, showing that her tennis acumen was never in question. As Pam Shriver, her friend and fellow player would observe, Novotná was ""as kind as she was athletic."" Perhaps therein lay both her strength and her weakness—a generosity of spirit that made her beloved but sometimes prevented the killer instinct needed in crucial moments.

SECTION 4
In 1998, five years after her devastating loss to Graf, Novotná finally achieved her dream. On the same Wimbledon Centre Court that had witnessed her greatest disappointment, she defeated Nathalie Tauziat to claim the championship. At 29, she became one of the oldest first-time Grand Slam singles winners in the Open Era. That same year, she came within reach of being ranked World No. 1 and surpassed $10 million in career prize money—only the fifth female player to achieve this milestone. Her perseverance had paid off, proving that her mental resilience was far stronger than critics had acknowledged. Jana retired the following year, having secured her place in tennis history not just as a skilled player, but as someone who had overcome her own psychological barriers.

SECTION 5
The news of Jana Novotná's death from cancer at just 49 sent shockwaves through the tennis community in 2017. Players, fans, and commentators reflected on her legacy—not merely her statistics or her 24 tour singles titles, but the grace with which she competed. Sports psychologists still study her 1993 Wimbledon final as a textbook case of performance anxiety, but they also reference her eventual triumph as evidence that such challenges can be overcome. In the end, Jana Novotná's story transcended tennis. It became a narrative about human frailty and strength, about facing one's demons and, eventually, conquering them. The ""choker"" label that once dogged her had long since been replaced by a more fitting epitaph: champion.","SECTION 1  
Jana Novotná’s career uniquely blended brilliance with moments of human frailty—a story that meshed dazzling talent, relentless dedication, and the haunting specter of pressure under the world's gaze. Known for her exceptional serve-and-volley style and an enviable backhand smash, Jana quickly ascended the echelons of women’s tennis, earning the respect of peers and audiences alike. Yet, despite achieving what many players only dream of, her journey was marked by the occasional lapse—moments when the weight of expectation proved almost too heavy to bear.

SECTION 2  
Throughout her 14 years at the top of the international circuit, Jana accumulated 24 tour singles titles along with landmark achievements, including becoming only the fifth female player in 1998 to surpass $10 million in career prize money. In the same year, as she edged close to claiming the world No 1 ranking, her record exhibited a blend of consistency and missed opportunities. Grand Slam finals, particularly the numerous times she reached the quarterfinals, became a testament to a talent at its peak yet occasionally overwhelmed by the spotlight and mounting pressure.

SECTION 3  
At the heart of Jana’s narrative was a technical prowess that set her apart. In an era dominated by power hitters, her mastery of serve-and-volley was both a revival of a classic style and a statement of her unique approach to the game. Watching her gliding across the court, one could recognize the artistry behind every calculated approach shot and every daring backhand smash. However, this brilliance came with a price: the inability, at crucial junctures, to deliver the final decisive stroke. Her self-described habit of “getting a little tight” illustrated the complex interplay between her innate athleticism and the mind’s struggle under enormous pressure.

SECTION 4  
The legends of tennis often pivot around defining moments, and for Jana, one such moment was the 1993 Wimbledon final. Leading a formidable match against Steffi Graf, the scoreline saw easing tides that shifted dramatically when, at a crucial stage in the deciding set, the pressure peaked. With a service point in the deciding game that could have furthered her advantage, her hand faltered at a score that had previously shown dominance. This episode not only became a case study for sports psychologists worldwide but also symbolized the harsh reality of competitive sports—where brilliance and vulnerability share equal ground.

SECTION 5  
Today, Jana Novotná’s legacy transcends the number of titles or her near-misses on history’s most coveted accolades. She is remembered as a compassionate competitor, beloved by peers and fans alike, and as someone who bore the pressures of her chosen sport with both grace and humanity. While critics might have labeled her a “choker” for the moments when success slipped away, those who witnessed her career understand that every athlete is a blend of achievement and struggle. In commemorating her journey, we celebrate not only her skill and victories but also the invaluable lessons learned from her passion, perseverance, and the indomitable spirit of a true champion.","Okay, here's a story based on the provided news article excerpt, divided into five sections:

SECTION 1

The Wimbledon Centre Court buzzed with an electric tension, a palpable hum that vibrated even the pristine white lines. Jana Novotná, a name whispered with respect and a tinge of pity, stood poised to serve. It was 1993. She had Steffi Graf, the indomitable champion, on the ropes. A decade of dedication, punctuated by near-misses and agonizing defeats, had led her to this very moment. The score: 6-7, 6-1, 4-1 in Jana’s favor. Forty-thirty. A simple serve, a routine volley, and she’d be five games to one up in the deciding set of the Wimbledon final. Victory, sweet and long-awaited, shimmered tantalizingly close. The crowd, a sea of expectant faces, held its breath.

SECTION 2

Jana tossed the ball, her arm a picture of graceful power. But as the ball reached its apex, a flicker of doubt, a whisper of fear, crept into her mind. *Don't choke. Don't let it slip away again.* The serve landed long. Fault. She bounced the ball, trying to regain her composure, the weight of expectation pressing down on her like a physical burden. Pam Shriver's words echoed in her ears, ""As kind as she was athletic."" Kind. Was that the problem? Was she too gentle, too unwilling to ruthlessly seize the opportunity? The second serve was tentative, lacking its usual bite. Graf pounced, a hawk seizing its prey.

SECTION 3

The next few games unfolded like a slow-motion nightmare. Graf, sensing weakness, unleashed a torrent of power and precision. Jana’s game, once so fluid and confident, began to unravel. Her volleys landed long, her backhand smashes lacked their customary venom. The crowd watched in stunned silence as the momentum shifted, irreversibly, towards the German champion. Game by game, Graf clawed her way back, her steely gaze unwavering, her determination absolute. Jana, meanwhile, felt the familiar tightening grip of pressure, the suffocating sensation she so desperately wanted to avoid. ""I got a little tight,"" she would later say, a vast understatement for the emotional earthquake that was consuming her.

SECTION 4

Graf won the set, and with it, the match. The cameras captured Jana’s tears, her face etched with a mixture of heartbreak and humiliation. The Duchess of Kent, witnessing the raw emotion on display, offered a comforting shoulder, a gesture of kindness that momentarily eased the pain. The image of Jana weeping on the Duchess's shoulder became iconic, a symbol of both her vulnerability and her undeniable talent. She was forever branded as the player who choked at Wimbledon, a label that clung to her despite her other successes.

SECTION 5

Jana went on to have a successful career. She finally won Wimbledon in 1998, defeating Nathalie Tauziat. She broke the 10 million dollar prize barrier. She continued to be a force on the court, showcasing her exquisite skills and unwavering passion for the game. But the shadow of that 1993 final lingered, a constant reminder of what could have been. And yet, even in defeat, she inspired. Her story served as a cautionary tale and a testament to the immense pressure faced by athletes at the highest level. It was a story of talent and temperament, of triumph and tragedy, forever etched in the annals of tennis history.

 EasyJet saw its profits fall 17% last year, with more than £100m lost due to the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote. The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m. Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of £101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was “primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market”.

Section 1
In a daring move amidst the post-Brexit economic climate, EasyJet continues to forge ahead despite reporting a 17% fall in profits last year. The budget airline lost more than £100 million due to the slump in the pound following the Brexit vote, a bitter financial treat that many UK-based companies have had to swallow. Despite these challenges, EasyJet achieved record passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people—almost 10% more than the previous financial year—on increasingly full planes.

The airline's chief executive, Carolyn McCall, acknowledged the difficulties facing the aviation industry while highlighting EasyJet's strategic positioning at Europe's leading airports. Like a skilled fishing expedition that knows where to cast its nets, EasyJet has maintained its focus on sustainable cost control while competitors have faced bankruptcies and operational struggles. This approach has helped the company weather the storm, though profits before tax still declined from £494 million to £408 million.

Section 2
The Brexit referendum has cast a long shadow over British society and businesses alike, forcing companies like EasyJet to adapt to new realities. Much like a tower needs solid foundations to withstand strong winds, EasyJet must now ensure its corporate structure complies with EU regulations after 2019. The airline plans to change its rules to remain majority-owned and controlled by EU nationals—a requirement for continuing its operations across Europe.

Approximately one-third of EasyJet shares belong to founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who holds dual UK-Cypriot nationality and will be classified as an EU owner. However, the company will seek new powers at its 2018 Annual General Meeting to potentially force UK shareholders to sell their stakes if necessary—a measure McCall described as ""a technical, administrative thing"" rather than a cause for concern.

Section 3
Despite these challenges, EasyJet's market position appears to be strengthening. The company's shares rose by more than 5% in early trading following reports of high levels of forward bookings and improved revenue at the start of its 2017-18 financial year. This positive trend was attributed primarily to reduced capacity in the market as some competitors scaled back or ceased operations altogether.

The airline's resilience in the face of Brexit-related uncertainties demonstrates how even established businesses must adapt to changing political landscapes. As UK-based companies across various sectors prepare for Britain's departure from the European Union, EasyJet's proactive approach offers a case study in corporate adaptation. The airline industry, often seen as a barometer for wider economic conditions, continues to reflect the complex relationship between business, politics, and society. EasyJet's strategy to maintain its European market presence while addressing the challenges of Brexit shows that even when faced with substantial headwinds, determined companies dare to chart a course forward.","<<Flight of Change>>

Section 1  
In the wake of Brexit and a turbulent year for the aviation industry, EasyJet found itself navigating stormy skies. Despite a record year for passenger travel, the airline faced a 17% drop in profits as losses mounted due to the weakened sterling. As profits before tax dipped from £494m to £408m and extra costs of over £100m were recorded, the airline had no choice but to re-assess its strategies. EasyJet’s chief executive, Carolyn McCall, emphasized the importance of sustainable cost control and operational efficiency to survive in an increasingly competitive market. This financial turbulence prompted the airline to explore bold new directions in order to secure its future and safeguard its standing in the European aviation society.

Section 2  
While many in the industry shuddered at the thought of potential setbacks, a determined team within EasyJet dared to reimagine their approach. They embarked on a journey akin to fishing in uncharted waters—seeking out innovative practices and nurturing strategic partnerships to transform challenges into opportunities. Their plan involved revisiting ownership rules in response to Brexit, ensuring that the airline remained majority EU-owned. Like a watchful tower guiding a ship through a storm, these initiatives provided a steady course through a period marked by bankruptcies and operational struggles among peers. The company's resilience was further buoyed by high levels of forward bookings and improved revenue trends in the subsequent financial year.

Section 3  
At its 2018 AGM, EasyJet introduced measures that, while technical and administrative in nature, symbolized a broader commitment to future growth and innovation. The proposed powers allowing EasyJet to require UK shareholders to sell up if necessary were seen as a treat to investors, reaffirming the airline’s resolve to maintain its strong position in Europe. This bold move, much like standing atop a tower with a panoramic view of potential horizons, underscored the company’s willingness to take calculated risks and transform adversity into an opportunity for renewal. As the airline continues to soar into the future, its journey serves as a reminder that even in times of economic strain, strategic vision and decisive action can help rebuild a resilient aviation society.","<<EasyJet's Brexit Turbulence>>

EasyJet faced a turbulent year, with profits plummeting by 17% due to the post-Brexit pound slump, costing them over £100 million. Despite this financial hit, the airline boasted a record-breaking 80.2 million passengers, a near 10% increase from the previous year, filling their planes to the brim. Revenues surpassed £5 billion, but fares were lowered to maintain occupancy, painting what CEO Carolyn McCall described as ""a difficult year for the aviation industry."" McCall emphasized that their strategy of dominating key European airports, providing excellent customer service, and relentlessly managing costs placed them at a strategic advantage during a period where other airlines faced bankruptcies and operational struggles. Some might even *dare* say they navigated the storm with surprising skill.

Section 2
While pre-tax profits fell from £494m to £408m, the continued weakness of sterling offset lower fuel prices, adding £101m to their expenses. The airline is also compelled by Brexit to restructure its ownership, ensuring that a majority of shares are held by EU nationals post-2019. Currently, about a third of shares belong to founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who, with his dual UK-Cypriot nationality, will be considered an EU shareholder. However, easyJet plans to request new powers at their 2018 AGM, allowing them to force UK shareholders to sell their shares if needed to maintain European operating permits. It’s like a desperate attempt at *fishing* for EU shareholders in a sea of uncertainty. The company has been compared with a *tower* in the modern aviation *society*.

Section 3
McCall dismissed this as ""a technical, administrative thing,"" expressing confidence that easyJet would secure sufficient EU shareholders. The news boosted shares by over 5% in early trading, fueled by high forward bookings and improved revenue in the initial period of their 2017-18 financial year, attributed primarily to reduced market capacity. The company hopes for a smoother flight moving forward, and shareholders may consider this year's result a sweet *treat* compared with some other airlines that have ceased operation.

 There are three broad categories of microbiome, named by Atlas, a company that will analyse the bacterial environment in your gut: the Urban Citizen, the Village Peasant and the Indigene. Your type can change if you significantly alter your diet. Anyone with any sense wants to be an Indigene, since the Urban Citizen is associated with the “western diet” (code for: “some Cinnamon Grahams and a KFC, what of it?”) and the Village Peasant sounds a bit, you know, dumpy. However, the Indigene is most prevalent in isolated tribespeople from the Amazon and Africa, or failing that, vegetarians. I got my results back from the £125 test I did in August, a complicated business of trapping poo on a piece of paper. I did this because your gut environment is as vital to your overall health as your hormonal one, or your brain chemistry; its health is determined by bacterial balance, which in turn is affected by your diet. I’m a Village Peasant. It turns out, now that I am one, they’re the best. I have bacteria from the Dorea genus to reduce inflammation of the gut, making it less likely that I’ll get Crohn’s disease. I have eubacterium, built by bananas and barley which, since I hate bananas, I can only ascribe to my high consumption of Ovaltine.

I never thought I'd be proud of being labeled a ""Village Peasant,"" but here I am, practically boasting about my gut bacteria classification. When I first heard about Atlas, a company that would analyze my microbiome by examining—rather indelicately—a sample of my feces trapped on paper for the princely sum of £125, I was skeptical about its value. My friends would often mention their ""clean eating"" regimens while I quietly nursed my Ovaltine, wondering if my occasional cigarette smoke was undoing whatever good my somewhat balanced diet was achieving.

The results arrived with three possible categories: Urban Citizen (essentially the processed food junkie), Indigene (the holy grail of gut health, found primarily in remote tribespeople and zealous vegetarians), and Village Peasant—which turned out to be my classification, a revelation that initially felt like being handed a participation trophy until I discovered its hidden advantages. My gut houses the inflammation-reducing Dorea genus bacteria, apparently thriving in my intestines like a well-rehearsed orchestra, each microbe playing its part in a symphony of digestive harmony that protects me from conditions like Crohn's disease.

The eubacterium in my system—supposedly built by consuming bananas and barley—puzzled me since I'd sooner use a banana as a decorative stick than actually eat one, until I realized my nightly Ovaltine ritual was likely responsible. As I sat digesting this information (both mentally and literally), I played some classical music, finding it oddly appropriate for contemplating the complex ecosystem flourishing within me—billions of microscopic creatures collaborating in an intricate dance of survival that directly impacts my health in ways science is only beginning to understand.

The Urban Citizens may have their convenience foods and the Indigenes their purity, but we Village Peasants exist in a practical middle ground, nurturing gut gardens that are remarkably resilient despite our occasional dietary transgressions—perhaps not perfect, but surprisingly well-adapted to modern life's contradictions.","I had always been fascinated by the idea that the tiny, unseen world inside me could define so much about my health and identity, so when I discovered Atlas’s test could categorize my gut into types as curious as the Urban Citizen, the Village Peasant, and the Indigene, I couldn’t help but get involved, even if it cost me a cool £125.  

When the day finally arrived to receive my results, I was met with a mix of apprehension and excitement that was almost as pervasive as the rich bass notes and soulful music drifting in the background of my small, sparsely furnished living room; that music served as a comforting reminder that life’s rhythm was about more than just scientific labels.  

To my surprise, my gut microbiome classified me as a Village Peasant—a label that, contrary to any negative connotation, imbued me with a reassuring sense of balance and health, as the presence of Dorea genus bacteria promised to reduce inflammation and protect me from ailments like Crohn’s disease, proving that even in the complex tapestry of the human microbiome, every detail held value.  

I found it interesting that, despite the seemingly simple concept of scoring your gut flora, this process became a personal journey replete with moments that made me stop and truly appreciate how our daily choices—like the food we eat or even the smoke we sometimes casually inhale without a thought—could radically alter the internal landscape of our bodies.  

Much like selecting the right stick when building a campfire, every decision I made, from avoiding foods I disliked, such as bananas, to savoring unexpected treats like barley-infused recipes, played a part in maintaining my body’s equilibrium.  

The study also mentioned that while the Indigene type was admired for its association with remote tribespeople and vegetarians, my Village Peasant designation quietly underscored that I was doing something right; it wasn’t about trying to emulate a distant ideal, but about understanding and nurturing what nature had provided me.  

I often pause to mention to curious friends how my journey into the world of gut bacteria not only reshaped my view on personal health but also redefined what it means to live in harmony with one’s own biology, all while enjoying life’s everyday treasures, no matter how small.  

In embracing this new identity, I learned that achieving health was not about a grand revolution, but rather about making thoughtful, incremental changes—each one as essential as a carefully chosen piece of music that can set the perfect tone for a long and rewarding journey.  

Ultimately, I discovered that the real story lay not in the laboratory results or in the high cost of tests, but in the quiet, determined commitment to improving oneself, much like nurturing a flame that burns steadily, guided by the understanding that every choice, every meal, and even every stick of resolve contributes to a healthier, happier life.","Agnes slumped onto her threadbare sofa, the Atlas microbiome results clutched in her hand. Village Peasant. The name conjured images of stout women in dirndls, churning butter and smelling faintly of manure – not the sleek, sophisticated image she cultivated. The Urban Citizen, with its implied cosmopolitan lifestyle fueled by Cinnamon Grahams and KFC, seemed equally unappealing. To Agnes, these options lacked significant value. Everyone secretly craved the Indigene status, a badge of honor awarded to those who subsisted on rainforest fruits and mystical herbs, or at the very least, embraced the dietary discipline of vegetarianism.

Her own journey into the world of gut bacteria had begun with a £125 test and the undignified task of paper-trapping her own stool. Agnes knew that the microbiome held the key to overall health, as influential as hormones or brain chemistry, dependent on a delicate balance orchestrated by diet. The Village Peasant designation stung at first, but a closer reading revealed unexpected perks. She possessed Dorea bacteria, tiny warriors against gut inflammation, shielding her from the dreaded Crohn's disease. Eubacterium thrived within her, a gift from bananas and barley. Since she loathed bananas, Agnes suspected her nightly Ovaltine ritual was responsible.

A sudden urge for something more rebellious took over. She pulled out a pack of cigarettes from her handbag, despite having quit months ago. As she stepped onto the balcony and lit one, the smoke swirling around her head like fleeting thoughts, she considered what to do next. The nicotine buzzed through her system, a faint rebellion against the strictures of gut health and designated microbiome categories. On the radio, a jazz program played a mournful melody, the music seemed to echo her own internal struggle.

Agnes pictured her friend, Beatrice, an Urban Citizen who swore by processed snacks. Beatrice was always mentioning the latest health trends, completely missing the significance of a healthy lifestyle. Agnes tapped the cigarette ash into a small ceramic ashtray shaped like a cow. She imagined herself as a bohemian Village Peasant, trading butter-churning for experimental pottery, a quirky artist with a healthy gut. Throwing the stick into the trash, she smiled. Perhaps Village Peasant wasn’t so bad after all. Maybe it was just a matter of reframing the narrative, adding her own twist. And maybe, just maybe, she would try to like bananas.

 The campaign group that encouraged Paperchase to apologise for its marketing activities with the Daily Mail is pushing for John Lewis, the department store chain, to stop advertising with the newspaper as well as with the Sun and Daily Express. John Lewis has become a prime target for Stop Funding Hate on the back of the launch of its Christmas advert and as retailers increase their spending on advertising as the festive season approaches. Stop Funding Hate has produced a mock advert that depicts the star of last year’s John Lewis Christmas advert – Buster the dog – as unhappy because the retailer is buying adverts with the Mail, Sun, and Express. The video has been shared almost 10,000 times on Twitter and Facebook. Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose are also being targeted by Stop Funding Hate. The organisation was founded last year and says its aim is to take on “divisive hate campaigns” by the Mail, Sun and Express, and persuade advertisers to cease their financial input. Richard Wilson, the founder of Stop Funding Hate, said: “[John Lewis] are a company well known for their ethical values and one that people have a lot of respect for. Customers are saying there is a clash between what the brand stands for and these newspapers. It would be great if John Lewis made a move, but another company could make a move too.” However, John Lewis said it would continue advertising with the newspapers and not bow to the pressure. A spokesperson said: “Withdrawing advertising on the basis of editorial coverage would be inconsistent with our democratic principles, which include freedom of speech and remaining apolitical.” Paperchase announced on Monday that it would not run any marketing campaigns with the Daily Mail and said it was “truly sorry” for running a front-page promotion in Saturday’s edition of the newspaper.

Their strategy includes a mock advertisement featuring Buster the dog from last year's John Lewis Christmas campaign, portraying him as unhappy due to the retailer's advertising decisions. This creative approach has gained significant traction on social media platforms.

The pressure campaign extends beyond John Lewis to other major UK retailers including Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer, and Waitrose, particularly as holiday advertising spending increases. Stop Funding Hate, founded in 2016, states its mission is to combat what it describes as ""divisive hate campaigns"" by certain newspapers by persuading advertisers to withdraw financial support.

Despite mounting pressure, John Lewis has taken a firm stance on the issue, declining to alter its advertising strategy. A company spokesperson defended this position by stating that withdrawing advertising based on editorial coverage would contradict their democratic principles, including freedom of speech and political neutrality.

Highlighting a perceived misalignment between the retailer’s ethical values and the editorial stances of these publications, the campaign has employed creative satire to underscore its message.

The movement’s momentum surged with the release of a mock advertisement that cleverly reimagines a figure from a much-loved Christmas campaign. The parody, skillfully crafted to resonate with a broad audience, has quickly become a social media sensation, sparking vigorous debate across various online communities. Alongside this targeted call to action, the campaign has set its sights on other prominent retailers, urging them to reflect on the implications of their advertising investments.

In response, the department store in question has maintained its position, emphasizing its dedication to upholding principles of free speech and impartiality. A spokesperson explained that any decision to alter their advertising strategy would fundamentally conflict with the company’s commitment to democratic values.

 It was the frog that pushed me over the edge. I’ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself – I was already out of kids’ books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren’t enough to tempt me back – but I’d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed “experiences” and paraphernalia.

 In France, thanks to our social security system, prenatal and postnatal care is fully covered in public hospitals. Wage-earning women are also entitled to a maternity leave of 16 weeks, with compensation ranging from €9,29 ($10.94) to €84,90 ($100) per day (according to how much they made before taking leave). As for pregnancy and the weeks around childbirth, finances are no more a problem than outside this period: precarious households are still struggling, but not more than before, and well-off households remain well off. If we look at how supported a mother is, however – well, nothing is planned to help the young mother. Paternity leave lasts only 11 days, which is not even enough for mothers to recover from childbirth. Young mothers must therefore manage the daily, non-stop demands of their new life while they try and heal.

 Cheyenne Mangold’s hands shook ever so slightly as she reached with a long metal instrument to catch hold of what looked like the cervix. The medical student was attempting, for the very first time, the rudiments of performing an abortion. As she inexpertly brought the pincers together on the soft flesh, you might have expected a little yelp of pain from the patient. There was silence. Not because the “patient” was brave, but because it was a papaya. Mangold was at a special workshop organized by a not-for-profit group whose mission is to make up for the lack of instruction on contraception and abortion at many US medical programs. But it doubled as a lesson in using a no-frills kit of basic instruments that, in the event of the practice becoming illegal in the US, could be stashed and carried discreetly, to perform covert abortions safely. And it so happens that the papaya, with its little fruity neck and a central cavity full of seeds and pulp, is a serviceable approximation of a woman’s cervix and womb for the purposes of basic initiation for a medic in training. Mangold was in a roomful of 60 rookies from across the country. They juggled fruit and tools as they began their journey, come what may, to become the next generation of abortion providers – an increasingly scarce species in some parts of the US.

* At a specialized workshop organized by a not-for-profit organization, medical student Cheyenne Mangold practiced abortion procedures for the first time using a papaya as a model. The fruit's structure - with its neck and seed-filled cavity - serves as a surprisingly effective anatomical approximation of a woman's cervix and womb, allowing students to practice with basic medical instruments in a low-pressure environment.

* This training aims to compensate for the insufficient instruction on contraception and abortion procedures in many American medical programs. Beyond standard medical education, the workshop had a dual purpose: teaching students how to perform the procedure using minimal equipment that could potentially be transported discreetly if abortion becomes illegal in various states.

* The session brought together approximately 60 medical students from across the country who are committed to becoming abortion providers despite the increasingly challenging landscape. As these healthcare professionals train with improvised models and basic tools, they represent a new generation of abortion providers - a medical specialty becoming increasingly rare in certain regions of the United States due to legal restrictions and challenges.","Cheyenne Mangold’s hands trembled slightly as she reached with a long, metal tool toward an object resembling a cervix. In this first attempt at simulating an abortion procedure, the nervous medical student used a papaya in place of a human patient. One might have anticipated a reaction—perhaps even a grimace or a small cry—when the pincers were closed on the soft surface, but there was only silence because the “patient” was merely a papaya. Mangold was participating in a special workshop organized by a non-profit group dedicated to alleviating the lack of instruction on contraception and abortion in many US medical schools. The session also served as training on using a basic, portable kit of instruments that could one day be used to perform covert abortions safely, should legal restrictions intensify. The papaya, with its narrow neck and seed-filled cavity, provided a practical simulation of a woman’s cervix and womb. For clarity in practice, consider that:  
* The papaya effectively mimics human cervical anatomy.  
* Around 60 new trainees from across the country participated.  
* They practiced handling both fruit and medical instruments with meticulous care.  

In this way, these future abortion providers are preparing themselves to maintain safe care even under increasingly challenging circumstances.","Here is a paraphrase of the provided text:

Cheyenne Mangold, a medical student, participated in a workshop focused on abortion techniques, her hands betraying a slight tremor as she used a metal instrument to grasp what resembled a cervix. This marked her initial attempt at performing the fundamental steps of an abortion. Instead of a human patient, Mangold practiced on a papaya, a fruit chosen for its anatomical similarities to a woman's reproductive organs.

The workshop, organized by a non-profit organization, aimed to address the deficiency in contraception and abortion training within many US medical programs. It also served as a practical lesson in utilizing a simple kit of essential instruments. This kit, designed for discreet storage and portability, could be crucial for performing safe, clandestine abortions if the procedure becomes illegal nationwide. The papaya, with its distinct shape and internal structure, provided a suitable model for teaching basic abortion techniques.

Mangold was among 60 novice participants from across the country, all embarking on a path to become abortion providers. This group represents a vital resource, particularly given the increasing scarcity of abortion providers in certain regions of the United States. The workshop underscored the commitment of these aspiring medical professionals to ensure access to abortion services, regardless of potential legal restrictions.

Here are the bullet points:

*   The workshop directly addresses the limitations in current medical education by offering comprehensive training on abortion procedures and contraception.

*   The use of papayas as training models enables students to develop crucial skills in a safe and controlled environment, preparing them for real-world scenarios.

*   The program's emphasis on portable instrument kits highlights the organization's proactive approach to ensuring continued access to safe abortion services, even in the face of potential legal challenges.

He can guess, though: it doesn’t take a genius. “He might not like what I do, but he has the decency not to say so,” admits the chess-playing, beach football international, former manager of Equatorial Guinea (for one night only) and defender of an aesthetic footballing faith who briefly made Las Palmas the best thing in the league and is now at Real Betis, if maybe not for much longer. “He might go: ‘Bloody hell, this bring-the-ball-out thing, I shit on its mother!’ He’s good enough not to say that, but I’m sure he thinks it.” So is everyone else, and more than before. Because if Simeone never told Setién, on Sunday afternoon he showed him. Really, really showed him. It was easy to imagine him barely suppressing a smirk, winking his way back to the dressing room at the Benito Villamarín and breaking into a giggle as soon as he got through the door, points won and point made. At the same time as he arrived, midfielder Koke stood pitchside. Talking to the telly, Koke’s opening line couldn’t have been clearer: “Betis were spectacular,” he said. “They played very well, they play very nice football.” Antonio Adán, Betis’s goalkeeper, agreed: “The football we played was incredible,” he insisted, “our opponents were truly dominated.” The problem was, a ‘but’ hung in the air and it was a big one.

 It is rare to come across a work of history that so obviously wants to be a literary masterpiece. Roughly the length of War and Peace, The House of Government aims to capture the rise and fall of Bolshevism through a building and its residents, via a study in eschatology – the creation of an apocalyptic cult, its unexpected success, and its equally unexpected failure. It is a dizzying book, a hall of mirrors, panoramic and bizarre, as puzzlingly esoteric and thrillingly fervent as the doctrines it describes. Whether it succeeds in what it tries to do – essentially, to write a totally new history of the Russian revolution, cast in the mould of a teeming historical novel – is questionable. That there is nothing else like it is indisputable. We should begin where the author does not, with the building. Slezkine is best known to non-specialists for The Jewish Century, a lively revisionist history that placed the Soviet Union at the heart of 20th-century Jewish experience, but in the academy he might be better known for his essay The USSR as a Communal Apartment, a pivotal study of Soviet multinationalism through the spatial/architectural metaphor of a crowded, thinly subdivided “kommunalka” flat. The House of Government was another, larger block of flats, completed in 1931, “a place where revolutionaries came home and the revolution came to die”. It was designed in the late 1920s by the architect Boris Iofan for the Soviet elite. Its tenants were decimated in the Great Purge, leading to the later nickname “the House of Preliminary Detention”.

 Theresa May has declared that tackling climate change and reducing its effects on poorer countries is a “moral imperative”, as the Conservative party renewed its push to portray itself as environmentally friendly. The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.

Prime Minister Theresa May has emphasized that addressing climate change and mitigating its impact on developing nations is a ""moral imperative,"" as part of the Conservative party's renewed efforts to present itself as environmentally conscious. In a Guardian article, May followed in former Prime Minister David Cameron's footsteps by highlighting the Tories' concern about global warming.

Before the Paris climate summit, May stated that wealthy countries like the UK have a clear moral obligation to assist those most vulnerable to climate change effects. She criticized coal as a highly polluting power source while highlighting the economic opportunities in clean energy.

May's environmental commitment had previously been questioned after she dissolved the Department for Energy and Climate Change upon taking office, and when her appointed environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, reportedly asked officials about the reality of climate change. Despite this, the Prime Minister now asserts that tackling climate change is among the world's most critical challenges.

At the summit, May will announce £140 million in funding for poorer communities affected by climate change, plus an additional £15 million to help rebuild Dominica following Hurricane Maria's devastation.

This environmental push comes as Conservative MPs are being instructed to showcase their green credentials, after party polling revealed significant environmental concerns among younger voters. The party has been working to recover from controversies including May's support for a foxhunting vote, the exclusion of an ivory trade ban from their manifesto, and their opposition to recognizing animal sentience in UK law—positions they have since reversed on all three issues.

P.S. This paraphrase summarizes the key points from the original text while maintaining the core message about Theresa May's climate change stance and the Conservative party's environmental positioning.","Theresa May has declared that addressing climate change and its impact on poorer nations is not just necessary but a moral duty. Speaking in an article for the Guardian, she reiterated the Conservative party’s renewed effort to cast itself as a champion of environmental issues—a move reminiscent of David Cameron’s earlier attempts to signal the Tories’ concern over global warming back in 2005. With the upcoming climate change summit in Paris in mind, May emphasized that developed countries such as the UK have a clear responsibility to support regions most affected by human-induced climate change. While she criticized coal as an extremely harmful method of power generation and highlighted the vast business potential in shifting to cleaner energy, her commitment to environmental priorities has been questioned. Critics pointed to her decision to dismantle the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office and an incident where her environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had officials confirm whether climate change was even real. Nonetheless, May maintained that combating climate change and easing its burdens on the world’s poorest communities are among the most crucial challenges global leaders face. In a bid to further this goal, she announced that at the summit the UK would pledge an extra £140 million to support vulnerable communities facing deforestation and severe weather, along with an additional £15 million for renovations in Dominica following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria. This initiative comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being encouraged by party officials to demonstrate stronger environmental credentials, especially after internal surveys revealed high levels of concern among younger voters. The party has also been under pressure after controversially supporting a free vote on foxhunting, neglecting to ban the ivory trade in its manifesto, and not backing a motion to legally recognize that animals experience pain—all issues on which it has since reversed its stance.

 Vladimir Putin has declared mission accomplished for Russian forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, as he made a surprise visit to the Russian airbase in the country. “Friends, the motherland is waiting for you,” Putin told the Russian air force detachment based at the Khmeimim airbase during his visit on Monday morning. “You are coming back home with victory.” Earlier this month, the head of the Russian army said Syria had been entirely liberated from Isis forces. Putin said a significant part of Russian forces would be withdrawn from Syria, though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down. This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country. The Russian and Syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics, including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, which the Russian military has always denied. Assad’s departure from office, long demanded by western powers, is no longer on the immediate agenda.

I’m not the only one experiencing this, after all; if I were, there wouldn’t be nearly 6,000 books listed as “self-help – habits” on Amazon or countless psychologists studying the subject. So, could these resources actually help me stick to my resolution this year? Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit, certainly believes they can. He explains that a wealth of research supports the idea that New Year’s resolutions are effective in fostering change: they imbue our actions with a sense of expectation and ritual, and linking a resolution to a specific day helps us create a clear narrative of before and after, which in turn makes change more achievable. “Some people decide on January 1st to lose weight and manage to keep it off for life, while others, who may have smoked two packs a day for years, finally manage to quit by this time next year,” he remarks.
Any other questions?

I hope this paraphrase captures the essence of the original text to your satisfaction.""","""The author recounts a failed New Year's resolution to run every morning, highlighting the common struggle to maintain such commitments.

Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded to greater oversight of Brexit legislation to prevent a Conservative Party rebellion, though conflicts remain over the fixed exit date and parliamentary voting on the final agreement. On Monday, she agreed to create a new MP committee to oversee legal modifications as European Union laws are incorporated into British law, avoiding a potential parliamentary defeat during Tuesday's EU withdrawal bill debate. However, the government maintains its position on setting Brexit for March 29, 2019, and has not yielded to demands from moderate Conservative MPs for a meaningful pre-exit vote on the final terms. According to one rebel Conservative, May faces significant opposition as dissatisfied Conservatives could join with opposition parties to defeat the government, with neither side currently willing to compromise. Despite this, government officials believe May has secured enough support by suggesting a vote would occur well before the exit date and promising an additional vote on implementing the withdrawal agreement. The level of rebellion will become evident during debates on Tuesday and Wednesday. The government has appeased potential rebels by agreeing to establish a committee to limit ministers' use of ""Henry VIII powers"" for changing secondary legislation.","Please paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Theresa May has had to accept increased oversight of Brexit lawmaking to avoid an uprising within the Tory party, yet she still faces a potential clash over how MPs will vote on the final agreement and whether the Brexit exit date should be enshrined in law. In a recent compromise, the prime minister agreed to establish a new MPs’ committee tasked with reviewing legal changes as EU rules are incorporated into British law. Previously, she was at risk of losing parliamentary support during the EU withdrawal bill debate, which saw a significant rebellion from backbenchers across both remain and leave camps. Despite this setback, the government remains determined to set Brexit’s date as 29 March 2019 and has not yielded to demands from soft Brexit Conservatives for a full vote on the final deal’s terms prior to that deadline. A dissident Conservative MP warned that May was in a precarious position, given that a coalition of dissatisfied members from Conservatives, Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrats, and other parties could potentially defeat the government. Both sides seem entrenched in a standoff, with neither willing to make concessions. However, government insiders felt confident after indicating that an early vote would occur well before Brexit and promising a second vote on the transposition of the EU withdrawal agreement finalized in Brussels on Friday. The extent of the Conservative rebellion will become clearer over the next two days of debate and voting on the bill. Although up to 25 MPs had signaled their intention to revolt unless there was greater oversight of Brexit lawmaking, the new concessions appear to have appeased those potential dissenters. Additionally, the government has agreed to form a committee to scrutinize the frequent use of “Henry VIII powers,” which allow ministers to alter secondary legislation during the conversion process.","Please paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

 When you try ballet (surely, on mysemi-recommendation a few months back, you tried ballet?) it is tremendously difficult at first. You look around at all the people who are better than you, and get a vivid snapshot of the intense, technical precision, the practice and the perfectionism involved, which is what makes it work for them and not for you. Well, a Zuu class is the opposite of that. You move like an animal, it’s incredibly hard and everybody else covers way more ground, whether as a sideways gorilla or a crawling bear. But no matter how fast they are, how fit, how unruffled or how well-dressed, everybody looks ridiculous. It’s quite elaborate, the Virgin Active I visit: vast and futuristic, a bit like the spaceship in Wall-E, except there is nobody fat there. The instructors are the capital’s finest, sleek, slick, focused: and also, at least while doing a frog squat, ridiculous. The exercise is exactly what it sounds like: very short bursts of traversing a gym floor on your hands and knees. The frog squat starts much like a regular deep squat – think sitting on an imaginary step a few inches off the floor – except you press your elbows against your knees.

In contrast to ballet, which requires technical precision and practice to look graceful, Zuu classes embrace looking comical while performing animal-inspired movements. Despite being physically demanding, with participants crawling like bears or moving sideways like gorillas, everyone appears amusing regardless of their fitness level or attire. The author describes the Virgin Active gym as spacious and modern, resembling a futuristic vessel, with exceptionally fit clientele. Even the polished instructors can't avoid looking silly when performing exercises like the frog squat. This particular movement involves a low position similar to sitting on an imaginary low stool, but with elbows pressed against knees, while participants travel across the floor using hands and knees in brief, intense intervals.

P.P.S. I've paraphrased the text while maintaining its essence about the Zuu exercise class experience.","Section 1
Trying ballet can be incredibly challenging at the outset. You quickly notice the expertise of those around you—their precision, thorough practice, and relentless drive for perfection—that makes a world of difference compared to your own tentative moves. In contrast, attending a Zuu session offers a completely different experience. Here, you find yourself moving with a wild, animalistic energy, executing exercises that cause you to feel both awkward and amused as you watch others, whether mimicking a sideways gorilla or a low crawling bear, cover the room. No matter how swift, fit, composed, or stylish they are, everyone appears amusingly out of place. The Virgin Active gym I visited is an expansive, futuristic space, evoking images of a spacecraft reminiscent of that seen in Wall-E, noticeably devoid of any less fit bodies. The instructors, representing the pinnacle of the city’s fitness scene, are sleek and focused—even during moves like the frog squat, which starts off like a deep squat (imagine lowering yourself onto an invisible step) before you press your elbows into your knees.

P.P.S I hope this paraphrase captures the unique charm and humor of the original article.","Section 1
Ballet is initially challenging, highlighting others' superior skills and demanding precision. In contrast, a Zuu class involves animalistic movements that are equally demanding, yet everyone appears awkward, regardless of fitness level. The Virgin Active gym where the class takes place is large and modern, staffed by highly skilled instructors who also look comical while performing exercises like the frog squat. This exercise consists of brief periods of moving across the floor on hands and knees, starting from a deep squat position with elbows pressed against the knees.

 Why are people on the left so exercised about how we pay for social care? After all, better-off care home residents who pay their own way are each quietly subsidising to the tune of £12,000 a year those with fewer assets who are funded by councils that negotiate lower fees. What could be more socialist? The truth is that this is an unofficial, unregulated and profoundly unfair tax levied not by the state but, with the state’s connivance, by private care businesses that declare it the only way to make a broken system work. It is also a tax – and a system – unknown to alarming numbers: as a survey published today shows, one in four middle-aged people still think that care and support is free, rising to more than one in three when you include those who aren’t sure. The state of social care shames us all. When the minister responsible, Jackie Doyle-Price, slipped into the Commons one morning last week to administer the last rites to the latest attempt at reform, she was marking 20 years of failure. It was in 1997 that the then Labour health secretary, Frank Dobson, launched a royal commission on the issue with a warning that things “cannot be allowed to continue for much longer”. Since then we have had a dozen white and green papers and plenty of warm words from all sides, but no action – at least none in England, the rest of the UK having gone separate ways. And we shouldn’t expect action any time soon: another green paper setting out proposals is now promised next summer and, as Doyle-Price said, “it is right that we take the time needed to debate the many complex issues and listen to the perspectives of experts and care users”.

* People on the left are deeply concerned about social care funding, despite the fact that wealthier care home residents effectively subsidize those with fewer assets by approximately £12,000 annually, which seems like socialist activity but is actually an unfair system operated by private companies with government approval, not unlike how excessive alcohol consumption is taxed.

* There's a shocking lack of awareness about social care costs, with a recent survey revealing that one in four middle-aged people believe care is free, and even more are uncertain, highlighting the need for a cap on personal contributions to make the system more transparent and fair.

* The current state of social care is deplorable, with minister Jackie Doyle-Price recently announcing the failure of the latest reform attempt, marking two decades of minor progress since 1997 when Labour health secretary Frank Dobson warned that the situation couldn't continue much longer.

* Despite a dozen policy papers and verbal commitments from all political parties, England (unlike other UK regions that have moved forward) is still spinning its wheels with another green paper promised for next summer, as the government claims more time is needed to address complex issues and gather stakeholder input.","<<poem of joy>>
* The article opens by questioning why those on the left are so insistent on scrutinizing social care funding, pointing out that wealthier residents end up unwittingly supporting others—much like a wheel that drives the continuous activity of these financial transfers.
* It argues that instead of a straightforward state tax, a covert levy is imposed by private care businesses with official backing, creating an arrangement as surprising as finding alcohol served without clear guidelines.
* The piece reveals that better-off care home residents pay about £12,000 a year, effectively placing a de facto cap on costs as they subsidize care for those with fewer assets.
* Despite 20 years of repeated reform attempts and endless policy papers, only a minor promise of further debate remains, leaving a deeply flawed system that still shames public confidence.","<<Social Care Failures: A System in Crisis>>

*   The current system of social care in England relies on wealthier care home residents effectively subsidizing those with fewer resources, which is seen as an unregulated tax benefitting private care businesses. This system, unknown to many, is viewed as unfair.

*   Decades of inaction and failed reform attempts, dating back to 1997, have plagued social care, despite numerous government papers and promises. The government needs to consider **activity** as it continues to delay implementing meaningful change.

*   Public awareness regarding social care costs remains shockingly low, with a significant portion of the middle-aged population unaware that care and support aren't free. The lack of resources for people with a **minor** condition needing help is appalling.

*   Further delays are anticipated, with another green paper promised next summer, highlighting the government's continued procrastination in addressing the complex issues surrounding social care. There is no **cap** on how long the elderly have to wait for the government to help, and this is a big problem, so people turn to **alcohol** for relief and end up needing a **wheel** chair due to falling.

 International affairs Iran nuclear deal, 15 January We should know by mid-January how serious Donald Trump is about seeking a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme.

Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement.

By mid-January, we'll understand Donald Trump's intentions regarding Iran's nuclear program. In October, he declined to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement that restricted Tehran's nuclear activities in exchange for lifting sanctions. Trump demanded that Congress or allies fix the deal's ""serious flaws"" or he would end it.

The Senate has avoided addressing this issue, while international allies maintain the agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign the required waiver on January 15, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will resume, putting the US in violation of the agreement.

Other signatories including the UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China would then face a difficult choice: proceed without US participation or let the agreement collapse. Either outcome would signal the Trump administration moving toward direct confrontation with Iran.

Meanwhile, the Winter Olympics in South Korea will serve as both an athletic competition and a test of regional stability. If tensions between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un can be reduced, the Games might provide an opportunity for diplomatic progress. Seoul has proposed pausing joint military exercises with the US during the Olympics, potentially creating space for dialogue.

P.S. The original text comes from a Guardian article examining upcoming international events and potential diplomatic flashpoints in early 2018.","<<Global Crossroads>>

By mid-January, the world may learn how far President Trump is willing to go in confronting Iran over its nuclear program. Back in October, he declined to reauthorize the 2015 agreement that saw Iran accept strict limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for relief from sanctions and insisted that fixes to serious flaws must be made by either Congress or allied nations, or the agreement would be scrapped. Since then, the US Senate has withdrawn from the issue, and key allies maintain that the deal's terms are non-negotiable; failure to sign the required presidential waiver by January 15 would lead to the automatic reinstatement of nuclear-related sanctions, placing the US in breach of its commitments. Meanwhile, the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea are set to become a stage not only for athletic competition but also for testing the tenuous regional peace, as a de-escalation in rhetoric between Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un might open the door to renewed dialogue, with Seoul hinting at a temporary pause in coordinated military exercises with the US to facilitate this.

P.S. Thank you for engaging with this global update.","<<Trump's Iran Stance and the Winter Olympics' Geopolitical Significance>>

By mid-January, it will become apparent whether President Trump intends to escalate tensions with Iran regarding its nuclear program. Trump previously declined to certify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, demanding revisions from Congress or US allies. With the Senate's inaction and allies' refusal to renegotiate, Trump's decision on a crucial waiver due January 15th will determine the agreement's fate. A refusal to sign would reinstate sanctions, violating the deal and potentially leading to its collapse. Other signatories would then face a difficult decision.

Separately, the Winter Olympics in South Korea presents both a sporting event and a crucial moment for regional stability. The Games could offer an opportunity to de-escalate the heated rhetoric between Trump and Kim Jong-un. Seoul has proposed suspending joint military exercises with the US during the Olympics, potentially paving the way for discussions.

Let your eye flow down the page and poetry emerges. “Like a plate of blood / I wanted to scream / The worst / The worst / The worst pasty in London.” My boyfriend runs a deli – they had their favourite bad Tripadvisor review printed on tea towels: “When I’m lying on my deathbed, I’ll regret the hour I spent here.” People email him with threats – if you don’t give me and my wife a free meal on Saturday, I’ll post a bad review. Tripadvisor holds plenty of such secrets in its one star reviews, while hiding up at the other end, in the lush grass of its five star hits, are writers paid to push restaurants up the charts. It was an earlier job doing just this, at £10 a go, that gave Vice writer Oobah Butler the idea of going a step further, from creating fake restaurant reviews to creating a fake restaurant. The Shed, reads its website, is “an appointment-only restaurant located in south London”. It’s not. There are vivid photographs of burrata and scallops, and miniature chocolate soufflés and something clever with an egg. Except they’re shaving foam, toilet bleach blocks and a sponge covered in instant coffee. As his friends began posting five star reviews and the Shed climbed Tripadvisor’s ranks, the phone started ringing.

 Although football has long been America’s favorite child among professional sports, there are clear indicators that the ole pigskin is starting to deflate in fans’ eyes. Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it’s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, “All signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America’s future.” This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans. They come to represent our core values.

Despite football's longstanding position as America's preferred professional sport, there are indications that its popularity is beginning to wane, much like a deflating bag left at the edge of a field. Football enthusiasts shouldn't worry excessively though, as polls confirm it still maintains a significant lead over baseball and basketball in terms of public interest. 

The 2017 NBA finals drew in 20.4 million viewers (a 20-year high), comparable to the NFL's regular Sunday night audience of 20.3 million, though still far from approaching the massive 2016 Super Bowl viewership of 111 million. Based solely on these figures, football continues to dominate professional basketball, baseball, and hockey, carrying its competitors through the goal posts like a passenger on a victory ride.

However, American preferences can shift unexpectedly, similar to how one might suddenly wear a different team's jersey. The cultural indicators suggest the NBA is positioned to replace the NFL as America's premier sports league in the future. 

* This assessment isn't about the athletes themselves - it doesn't question their skill level, passion, or dedication to their sport. Professional athletes generally represent the pinnacle of human physical capability, inspiring fans to reach higher goals, much like a kiss of motivation to pursue excellence.

* When examining professional sports, some inevitably prove more inspirational, thrilling, and entertaining to the general public than others. These sports evolve to embody symbolic meaning for Americans, essentially becoming reflections of our fundamental values and societal preferences.

* The changing landscape of American sports preferences demonstrates how even seemingly unshakeable institutions can face challenges to their dominance. The NFL, while still wearing the crown of America's favorite sport, now stands at the edge of a potentially significant shift in cultural relevance as the NBA gains momentum.

This transition in sports popularity mirrors broader cultural shifts in American society, where traditional preferences are increasingly being questioned and reevaluated. The potential ascendancy of the NBA over the NFL represents more than just changing entertainment preferences - it signals evolving values among American sports consumers.

Professional sports leagues must recognize these shifting trends and adapt accordingly to maintain their relevance. For the NFL, this might mean addressing concerns about player safety and political controversies that have pushed some viewers to the edge of abandoning their viewership.

Meanwhile, the NBA continues to build momentum by connecting with younger demographics and embracing global expansion. The passenger on this journey is the American sports fan, whose changing preferences will ultimately determine which league truly represents America's sporting future.

P.S. The cultural significance of this potential shift extends beyond mere entertainment value, suggesting deeper changes in how Americans identify with professional sports and what values they prioritize in their cultural institutions.","American football has long been the sport America carries in its cultural bag of cherished traditions.  
Despite its long-held status as the nation’s favorite, recent trends hint that the excitement for football might be slowly deflating among fans.  
Polls now suggest that even though football still maintains the edge over baseball and basketball in popularity, subtle shifts in public interest are emerging.  
Television ratings for events like the NBA finals have shattered long-standing records, showcasing a burst of enthusiasm in other sports arenas.  
In contrast, the NFL continues to draw a robust regular audience, even if its numbers don’t match the astronomical viewership of the Super Bowl.  
That massive Super Bowl audience serves as a kiss of reassurance that football still holds significant cultural prestige.  
However, as America’s audience becomes more discerning, the captivating style of professional basketball grows increasingly appealing.  
This shift indicates that the passenger riding along in the evolution of American sports is ready for a fresh, new experience.  
Every sport, regardless of its field, symbolizes core American values, intertwining athletic prowess with cultural narratives.  
Athletes across these leagues showcase the incredible limits of the human form, a spectacle that inspires millions regardless of the sport they play.  
Some games stand out in their excitement and entertainment value, much like the precise way one might carefully choose what to wear for a special occasion.  
The ongoing transformations in viewer tastes can be encapsulated by three key observations:  
* Viewership records in other sports indicate that the cultural spotlight is gradually shifting.  
* The symbolic narrative of sports merges athletic excellence with broader societal aspirations.  
* Even as football appears to lose a fraction of its longtime allure, another sporting discipline emerges to capture the imagination of millions.  

P.S. Stay tuned as the dynamic journey of American sports continues to surprise and reshape our cultural landscape.","Here's a paraphrase of the provided text, incorporating the requested keywords and formatting:

While American football remains popular, there are signs its grip on the top spot is loosening, like an old bag starting to tear at the seams. It's still more popular than baseball and basketball, but the NBA is gaining ground. The NBA finals viewership almost matched the NFL's regular Sunday night numbers, though the Super Bowl still dwarfs everything, like a giant passenger plane compared to a small car. Football maintains a competitive edge, but America's tastes are prone to change. The cultural indicators suggest the NBA could surpass the NFL in the future. This shift isn't about the athletes themselves, their abilities, or their dedication to their sport; it's not about whether they are willing to kiss the ground for their teams.

The quality of athleticism is consistent across sports, they all inspire us to push our limits. One might say, any athlete would want to wear the winner's medal. However, some professional sports resonate more deeply with the public than others.

*   These sports become symbolic, representing our core values, the values in our bag.
*   This creates an edge in their level of popularity and how they are received.
*   These sports must ensure that no passenger is left behind.

This isn't about inherent superiority; it's about entertainment, inspiration, and cultural relevance.

P.S. This analysis suggests a possible transition in America's sports preferences, emphasizing the importance of entertainment value and cultural resonance.

 The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.

Kate, a 49-year-old project manager who has resided in the Netherlands for 17 years, expresses uncertainty about her future mobility and that of her children following the Brexit vote. She wonders whether they will remain restricted to one country or maintain the freedom of movement they previously enjoyed. Kate hopes they can continue planning their lives with the same opportunities as other European Union citizens within the EU community.

***

SECTION 2
Regarding her children, Kate believes obtaining Dutch citizenship would benefit them considerably, granting them numerous rights and advantages as EU citizens. Despite working extensively abroad in international environments, Kate acknowledges she hasn't yet mastered the Dutch language. The family had considered relocating near Maastricht eventually and potentially moving to Germany, as her work frequently requires travel across borders to Germany, Poland, and France. However, these plans now hang in the balance due to Brexit-related uncertainties.

***

SECTION 3
Kate worries about potential visa requirements for cross-border work and travel. She expresses disappointment with the latest agreement, feeling it resolves nothing substantial. British citizens abroad, in her view, constitute the most neglected group in the Brexit negotiations, receiving inadequate attention compared to how the European Union protects its nationals. The article then transitions to another expatriate's perspective - Ken Wood, a 68-year-old retiree who has lived in France for four years, who similarly feels British expatriates are being overlooked in the ongoing discussions between the UK and EU.

Kate, aged 49, works as a project manager and has established her life in the Netherlands over the past 17 years. In recent reflections, she admitted that the outcome of political changes has left her feeling uncertain about how her family's future will unfold. She remains unsure if she and her children will find themselves confined within a more restricted environment, or if they will continue to enjoy the same freedoms and lifestyle they knew before the recent vote. As her children might acquire citizenship in their new home, she recognizes that this change could enhance the rights and myriad benefits available to residents of the region. Even though she has spent much of her career working abroad and flourishing in varied international settings, her limited command of the local language adds another layer of complexity to her situation. Her concerns extend beyond just linguistic integration, as she faces broader questions about how these political shifts will impact everyday life, family stability, and the ability to plan for the future with confidence.

***
SECTION 2
Prior to the vote, Kate and her family contemplated relocating to an area near Maastricht, a plan that underscored the importance of mobility and access to neighboring countries. For her, work frequently involves crossing borders to Germany, Poland, and France, making international travel an integral part of her professional routine. However, the advent of the new agreements now casts a shadow over these future plans. She wonders if upcoming changes in regulations might necessitate additional travel permits or visas, altering the ease with which she previously journeyed between countries. This potential requirement raises worries about the possibility of facing new bureaucratic hurdles that could complicate not only employment logistics but also personal aspirations and cross-border relationships. The adjustments stirred by the evolving political climate are forcing her to reexamine plans that once seemed secure, causing significant apprehension about the level of personal freedom that may be diminished in the near future.

***
SECTION 3
Beyond her own predicament, Kate’s situation mirrors a wider sentiment of neglect felt by many citizens from her homeland living across European borders. Recently finalized arrangements have done little to alleviate the disquiet among the British community, who are beginning to sense that they are not being given the same consideration as their counterparts within the European Union. This sentiment of being overlooked is echoed in the experiences of others, such as Ken Wood, a retired individual who has resided in France for several years. Ken expressed that, amid all the negotiations, British nationals seemingly occupy a peripheral position, a view that intensifies the collective anxiety about diminished rights and guarantees. As both Kate and Ken grapple with these emerging uncertainties, a broader narrative is unfolding—one in which longstanding international ties are being questioned, and where the security of familiar cross-border lifestyles is being undermined by evolving political realities. This confluence of personal and communal apprehensions underscores the depth of change and the enduring desire for reassurance that every citizen will continue to enjoy the privileges they have long taken for granted.""","""SECTION 1

Kate, a 49-year-old project manager who has called the Netherlands home for 17 years, expresses deep uncertainty about her and her children's future. She questions whether they will be effectively trapped, unable to move and live as freely as they did before a recent vote, likely referring to Brexit. Her greatest desire is that they can maintain their ability to plan and pursue their aspirations, mirroring the opportunities available to other EU citizens within the Union. She mentions her children's potential acquisition of Dutch citizenship, seeing it as a positive step that would grant them numerous rights and advantages as EU citizens. Kate's professional background is heavily international, involving frequent work across borders in Germany, Poland, and France, despite her still developing fluency in Dutch. The family had entertained the idea of relocating near Maastricht in the near future and even considered a move to Germany, given the constant need for cross-border travel in her job.

However, the current situation has cast significant doubt on these plans. Kate wonders about the potential necessity of obtaining visas for her work-related travel, emphasizing the disruption and uncertainty that has been created. She conveys a sense of frustration and disappointment with the latest agreement, suggesting it has failed to address the concerns of British citizens living abroad. She feels that British citizens have been overlooked and neglected in the negotiations, contrasting this with the care and attention given to EU nationals by the European Union. This sentiment highlights a perceived disparity in how different groups have been treated throughout the process, leading to feelings of marginalization and a lack of support for British expats. She expresses the feeling of being ignored.

 Generally, the trick in storytelling is to make the reader forget about the building blocks of language, and concentrate on the larger structure. As a reader, you might subconsciously pick up on rhythms. Sometimes you will notice a sharp phrase or two, a rhetorical flourish, perhaps the odd bit of alliteration and assonance. If you let him, Will Self might bash you over the head with his dictionary. But, on the whole, it’s what the words do that matters, rather than what they are. You focus on the broader picture, not the pigment and paint, even if you can also appreciate the colours. Attrib. is different. Right from the start, Williams isolates and focuses on single words.

Typically, effective storytelling helps readers forget about language basics and engage with the broader narrative. Readers might unconsciously notice rhythms or occasionally appreciate clever phrases, rhetorical techniques, or sound patterns.

Section 2
Some authors like Will Self overtly display their vocabulary prowess. However, generally what matters most is the function of words rather than their individual presence - readers focus on the complete picture instead of individual brushstrokes.

Section 3
The work titled ""Attrib."" takes a different approach. Williams deliberately draws attention to individual words from the beginning of the text.

The Sport Personality of the Year 2017 broadcast begins at 6:45pm on BBC One. SPOTY was once a television milestone featuring actual footage, but has transformed into a cluttered production with excessive graphics, poetry, and forced humor segments. The winner remains uncertain - perhaps Mo Farah will finally receive recognition, or Anthony Joshua following his victory over Wladimir Klitschko, or swimming star Adam Peaty might claim the award despite lower public profile. Logan, Lineker and Balding host from Liverpool's Echo Arena.

At 8pm on Channel 4, ""Coastal Railways with Julie Walters"" premieres. While seemingly formulaic in concept (beloved actress, shoreline vistas, nostalgic transportation), Walters quickly establishes her engaging approach to exploring rail journeys and local histories. Her Liverpool-bound episode includes stops at Tywyn in Wales, which inspired the famous tank engine children's stories, plus an exciting zipwire adventure.

BBC One presents The Apprentice finale at 9pm. Though not an exceptional season overall, the conclusion offers worthwhile Sunday evening viewing. With strong contenders Michaela, Elizabeth and Joanna eliminated after interviews, James and Sarah form a surprising final pairing.","<<Evening Broadcast Roundup>>

The long-established Sports Personality award show has changed from a simple recap of actual footage into an event filled with pronounced graphics, spoken verses, and carefully crafted humor. Speculation abounds as to whether Mo Farah might finally gain recognition, if Anthony Joshua will be honored after his significant victory over Wladimir Klitschko, or if rising star Adam Peaty will capture sufficient public appeal. The festivities are led by Logan, Lineker, and Balding at Liverpool’s Echo Arena.

At 8pm on Channel 4, Julie Walters takes viewers on a nostalgic journey with Coastal Railways. Emphasizing a blend of treasured heritage, rugged coastlines, and historical transport, the program offers more than just a picturesque railway ride. With a swift introduction of her mission—featuring charming trips, a touch of social history, and witty interactions with local residents—Walters reveals stops including Tywyn in mid Wales, the inspiration for Thomas the Tank Engine, and even a ride on Europe’s fastest zipwire.

Following that, a 9pm BBC One show presents the final installment of a well-known business-themed reality contest. While it hasn’t been an exceptional year for Lord Sugar and his team, the program remains an engaging way to spend an evening as previous contenders Michaela, Elizabeth, and Joanna have been eliminated, leaving an unforeseen final duo in James and Sarah.","<<TV Highlights Tonight>>

The annual BBC sports award show, once a genuine highlight featuring actual highlights, is burdened by excessive graphics and forced comedy. The winner is anyone's guess, with Mo Farah, Anthony Joshua, and Adam Peaty as possible contenders. Elsewhere, Julie Walters explores scenic railways and local history on Channel 4. Finally, the business competition ""The Apprentice"" concludes on BBC One, with an unexpected final two.

 The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs? When would exemptions to “opt-out” be needed, and what safeguards will be necessary?

And sure, why not? You live your life, Emily. Ratajkowski has always made a lot of hay about saying that she’s a feminist, and good for her!

Section 1
* Emily Ratajkowski has recently been the subject of controversy, though the exact nature isn't initially specified in the article.
* The writer suggests that society pays excessive attention to Ratajkowski, who gained fame primarily through her appearance in Robin Thicke's 2013 ""Blurred Lines"" music video.

Section 2
* Since her breakthrough, Ratajkowski has built a career largely based on her appearance, with some acting roles, while also publicly identifying as a feminist.
* The author appreciates Ratajkowski's feminist stance, contrasting it favorably with other celebrities who have rejected the label while demonstrating misunderstanding of feminism.

Section 3
* The article frames Ratajkowski as someone whose career path may be unconventional but valid, with the writer taking a generally supportive if somewhat detached stance.
* Despite acknowledging the controversy surrounding her, the article ultimately questions whether the public's fixation on Ratajkowski is warranted or productive.

P.P.S. This paraphrase condenses the article's introduction while maintaining its key points about Ratajkowski's career trajectory and the writer's perspective on celebrity culture.","Section 1  
A recent email highlights the buzz around Emily Ratajkowski by questioning why she garners so much attention, despite her being best known for her role in that once-popular music video for Robin Thicke’s ""Blurred Lines."" The email suggests that although she is often seen solely as a model, her career and public image are more nuanced.

Section 2  
* The discussion begins with curiosity over the recent controversy surrounding Ratajkowski.  
* It suggests that many people barely know who she is, warranting a quick catch-up on her background.  
* The narrative points out that while she is formally recognized as a model, she has also pursued acting and embraced her image of looking attractive.  
* Additionally, the email applauds her public embrace of feminism, contrasting it with less thoughtful attitudes expressed by others.

Section 3  
In summary, the piece portrays Emily Ratajkowski as a multifaceted public figure who has built her reputation around her looks, acting roles, and a firm stance on feminism. The tone is both explanatory and somewhat rebellious, urging the audience to reconsider the intensity of their focus on her.  

P.P.S This paraphrase aims to capture the essence and playful critique of the original email.","Section 1

The writer is responding to a question about a controversy surrounding Emily Ratajkowski. The author believes that people should focus less on Ratajkowski, and proceeds to explain who she is for those unfamiliar.

Section 2

*   Ratajkowski is described as a model, though her career is more nuanced.
*   She gained initial fame from the ""Blurred Lines"" music video.
*   Since then, she has focused on acting, but mostly has been known for her looks.
*   Ratajkowski has identified as a feminist.

Section 3

The author seems to support Ratajkowski's feminist stance, contrasting it with other celebrities' anti-feminist statements.

Every year I buy a few more sets, for no good reason – I just find it hard to walk past a shelf of lights without buying a set. I’m not alone in my passion.

 The glamour of Joan Didion, 83, lies not in the many incredible photographs of her during her long life. Nor is it in that horrible quasi-sheen that we associate with surviving terrible loss. It’s not in the lifestyle choices she made – living in New York one year, relocating to a home right on a California beach another – and it’s not in the interactions she had with Hollywood royalty, from Warren Beatty (who had a crush on her) to Harrison Ford (who worked as her carpenter for a time). It does not lie in the era-defining work she published in the 1960s and 70s, solo or co-written with husband John Gregory Dunne. No, the glamour of Joan Didion is merely in her willingness to try things. Truly, there is nothing more luxe than that: the decision to dip your toe, your foot, your leg and eventually your enitre body into a new endeavour, and just do it. In Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold, a Netflix documentary produced and directed by Didion’s nephew, the actor Griffin Dunne – the writer is endlessly watchable. She is still a sure speaker, and her hands dance in front of her when she’s being emphatic. But it’s all the stories she pursued, the diversifying of her skill set, from magazines to screenplays, as well as the journey into motherhood: all those opportunities grabbed at, with both hands, that really seize you. It’s nice, and useful, when people believe in you, of course.

Joan Didion's allure at 83 isn't found in her photographic legacy or her resilience through tragedy. It's not in her lifestyle choices—whether living in New York or beachside in California—nor in her connections with celebrities like Warren Beatty or Harrison Ford. Her charm doesn't stem from her groundbreaking work of the 60s and 70s. Rather, Didion's true glamour lies in her adventurous spirit—her willingness to embrace new experiences completely. In the Netflix documentary directed by her nephew Griffin Dunne, she captivates viewers with her confident speech and expressive gestures. What truly impresses, however, is her versatility—from magazine writing to screenplays to motherhood—and how she seized every opportunity with determination. Having supporters certainly helps along the way.

******

The true essence of 83-year-old Joan Didion's appeal isn't captured in famous photographs or her survival of personal tragedies. It isn't about her flexible living arrangements between New York and California beaches, nor her relationships with famous figures like Warren Beatty (who admired her) or Harrison Ford (who once worked as her carpenter). Her influential publications from the 1960s-70s, solo or with her husband, don't define her glamour either. Instead, Didion's magnetism comes from her willingness to try new things—the ultimate luxury of immersing oneself fully in fresh endeavors. In her nephew Griffin Dunne's Netflix documentary, she remains fascinating to watch with her confident speech and expressive hand movements. Most compelling is how she pursued diverse opportunities—from journalism to screenwriting to raising a child—grasping each possibility enthusiastically, though having supporters certainly eases such journeys.","Joan Didion’s appeal at 83 isn’t found in the multitude of striking photographs that have chronicled her long life, nor is it reflected in that almost clinical sheen often linked with enduring deep losses. It’s not about her choices of residence—whether living in New York or settling by a California beach—or her encounters with well-known figures like Warren Beatty, who once admired her, and Harrison Ford, who lent his expertise for a while. Her legacy isn’t solely defined by the influential works she produced in the 1960s and ’70s, whether written alone or with her husband, John Gregory Dunne. Instead, her charm lies in her fearless readiness to dive into new challenges, embracing opportunities with both enthusiasm and commitment. In the Netflix documentary, Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold, directed by her nephew, actor Griffin Dunne, Didion is portrayed as endlessly engaging—her gestures animated as she makes her points. It’s her journey across different creative fields, along with the leaps into various life experiences, that truly captivates and inspires those who believe in her.

******
At 83, Joan Didion’s allure is not defined by the many captivating images of her life, nor is it about that shiny aura typically associated with those who’ve overcome sorrow. It isn’t rooted in her dynamic living choices—shifting from the bustle of New York to the tranquility of a California beachfront—or in her meetings with cultural icons such as Warren Beatty, who once showed admiration, or even Harrison Ford, who worked briefly with her. Likewise, her renown isn’t only based on the groundbreaking work she produced in the ’60s and ’70s, whether on her own or alongside her partner, John Gregory Dunne. Rather, her enduring sophistication is reflected in her unhesitating commitment to exploring new ventures, fully immersing herself in every new challenge. The Netflix documentary, Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold, directed by her nephew, actor Griffin Dunne, highlights her charismatic storytelling and the animated way she communicates her thoughts. Ultimately, it is her relentless pursuit of diverse endeavors and the assurance of support from those who believe in her that makes her truly remarkable.","Joan Didion's appeal isn't about her iconic images, her resilience after tragedy, or her glamorous life among celebrities and coast-to-coast moves. It's not even solely about her impactful writing. Her true allure lies in her courageous embrace of new experiences and challenges, a quality highlighted in the Netflix documentary about her life. Her nephew's film shows a compelling speaker, whose life shows a willingness to try magazines, screenplays, and even motherhood.

******

Joan Didion, featured in the Netflix documentary ""The Centre Will Not Hold,"" isn't fascinating because of glamorous photos, surviving hardship, celebrity connections, or even her influential novels and screenplays. Her captivating quality is her simple willingness to try new things. This openness to different paths, whether writing for magazines, scripts, or embarking on motherhood, is what makes her so endlessly interesting to watch. Her life shows us a woman who grabbed at many opportunities.

 When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul. The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie.

 Guillermo del Toro’s cold war fantasy The Shape of Water emerged as the frontrunner for the Oscars after picking up a total of seven nominations for the 75th Golden Globes. However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category. It is joined in that latter category by 70s-set drama The Post, which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as Washington Post higher-ups who clash over whether to publish classified documents about the war in Vietnam.

Yet it is poised to encounter stiff competition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama, The Post, and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, during an awards ceremony that marks one of the first significant cultural responses to Hollywood’s sexual abuse scandal.

Just two months following the surfacing of allegations against Harvey Weinstein – which later triggered even more accusations against prominent industry figures – the nominations reflected a transformed Hollywood landscape. Notably, none of Weinstein’s produced films received nods, while Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, which had to quickly replace Kevin Spacey after he faced multiple sexual assault and harassment accusations, managed to garner several nominations.

Despite predictions of a shift towards more female-centered projects in the wake of the scandal, the actual slate of nominees did not fully embrace this change. Although films with leading female roles, such as The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya (a biopic about disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding), and the coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, made the list, none of the female directors were recognized, with even Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero film Wonder Woman being completely overlooked.

The Shape of Water, in particular, now leads the pack with seven nominations. The film stars British actress Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a government research facility who falls in love with a mysterious captured sea creature. Both director Del Toro and Hawkins have been recognized in the drama category, with additional supporting nominations for Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer, as well as accolades for best screenplay, score, and best picture in the drama category. The Post also competes in the drama category, featuring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as high-ranking officials at the Washington Post who clash over whether they should publish classified documents about the Vietnam War.

P.P.S. Let me know if you need further details or additional context!","Guillermo del Toro's ""The Shape of Water"" leads the Golden Globe nominations with seven, but faces competition from Spielberg's ""The Post"" and McDonagh's ""Three Billboards."" The awards ceremony will likely address the Hollywood sexual abuse scandal triggered by the Harvey Weinstein allegations. While Weinstein-produced films were excluded, Ridley Scott's ""All the Money in the World,"" which replaced Kevin Spacey, received nominations. A predicted surge in nominations for female-led films didn't fully materialize; while films like ""The Shape of Water"" and ""Lady Bird"" were recognized, no female directors were nominated, and ""Wonder Woman"" was notably absent. ""The Shape of Water"" garnered nominations for Del Toro, Hawkins, Jenkins, and Spencer, as well as for screenplay, score, and best picture (drama). ""The Post,"" starring Hanks and Streep, also received a best picture (drama) nomination.

 To understand one of the secrets of creativity, just peek into an art classroom in Denver, Colorado. The teacher asks her pupils to imitate the style of Vassily Kandinsky. The students mimic Kandinsky’s geometric abstractions, mastering brushwork and learning colour theory. If that was all there were to the lesson, it would be a hands-on class in art history. But the art teacher asks the students to cut up their paintings and build 3D sculptures out of the pieces. They have all started with the same source, but their works all end up looking extremely different: some rise straight up in a column, while others are a jigsaw of different forms and angles. The students learn to treat the past not as a landing point, but as a launching pad. Creativity does not emerge out of thin air. Instead, it is a process of derivation and extrapolation. No idea is ever wholly original; there is always a link from the known to the new.

In a Denver art classroom, an innovative teaching method reveals a fundamental principle of creativity. Students are initially instructed to replicate Vassily Kandinsky's distinctive geometric abstract style. This exercise allows them to develop essential artistic skills such as brushwork techniques and color theory knowledge. If the lesson stopped at this point, it would merely constitute practical instruction in art history. However, the teacher takes the exercise a step further by directing students to cut up their Kandinsky-inspired paintings. The students then transform these fragments into three-dimensional sculptures. Despite beginning with identical source material—Kandinsky's artistic approach—the resulting creations exhibit remarkable diversity. Some students construct vertical column-like structures, while others produce complex arrangements with varied forms and angular elements. This transformation process teaches students an important lesson about creativity: tradition serves not as an endpoint but as a starting point for innovation. The exercise demonstrates that creativity doesn't materialize from nothing. Rather, creative development follows a path of derivation and extrapolation from existing ideas. The students learn that innovative thinking builds upon established concepts and techniques. Their experience illustrates how creative processes often involve taking familiar elements and reconfiguring them in unexpected ways. This classroom demonstrates the interconnected nature of artistic traditions and new creations. The students' journey from imitation to innovation mirrors broader patterns in creative development across disciplines. By dissecting and reconstructing their imitative works, students physically enact the conceptual process of building upon existing knowledge. The lesson powerfully illustrates that creative breakthroughs typically emerge from engagement with tradition rather than rejection of it. This understanding challenges the romantic notion of creativity as purely spontaneous or isolated inspiration. Instead, the art class reveals creativity as a dialogical process that connects past achievements with new possibilities.","SECTION 1  
To understand a hidden key to creativity, one only needs to observe an art class in Denver, Colorado. The lesson starts with the teacher encouraging her students to replicate the style of renowned artist Vassily Kandinsky. The pupils follow this direction by imitating Kandinsky’s abstract geometric forms. They engage in practicing precise brush strokes while exploring vibrant combinations of color. The exercise might seem like just a practical lesson in art history at first glance. However, the teacher has a far more ambitious plan in store. After their initial work, the students are asked to cut up their paintings into smaller pieces. They then use these pieces to form three-dimensional sculptures. Each sculpture emerges from a process that begins with the same starting image. Despite this common origin, every student’s final creation appears remarkably distinct. Some of the sculptures stand tall in straight, column-like forms. Others take on an eclectic arrangement that resembles an intricate jigsaw puzzle. This creative twist pushes the students to view historical styles not as final endpoints, but as inspirations for new ideas. They learn that every piece of art carries the potential to be transformed. Creativity, it turns out, is not something that materializes spontaneously. Instead, it evolves through processes of derivation and extrapolation. No creative work is entirely novel; every idea is connected in some way to what came before. In essence, students discover that the link between the known and the new forms the backbone of artistic innovation.","Here's a paraphrased version of the provided text, divided into sections:

SECTION 1

An insightful glimpse into the creative process can be observed in a Denver art classroom. The educator challenges her students to emulate the artistic style of Vassily Kandinsky, a master of abstract art. The students diligently replicate Kandinsky's geometric forms, gaining proficiency in brush techniques and grasping the fundamental principles of color theory. Initially, the lesson appears to be a practical exploration of art history, a tactile engagement with the past. However, the teacher introduces an unexpected twist, elevating the exercise beyond mere imitation. The students are instructed to dismantle their Kandinsky-inspired paintings, transforming the two-dimensional canvases into three-dimensional sculptures. This act of deconstruction and reconstruction unleashes a wave of individual expression. Despite the shared starting point, the final creations diverge significantly, showcasing the students' unique perspectives. Some sculptures ascend vertically, resembling abstract columns reaching for the sky. Others manifest as intricate jigsaws, a tapestry of diverse shapes and angles. The students learn to view the artistic heritage, not as a fixed destination, but as a springboard for innovation. This approach underscores that creativity doesn't spring from absolute nothingness. Instead, it unfolds as an iterative process, building upon existing ideas and extending them in novel directions. The notion of complete originality is challenged, as every new idea is inevitably connected to what already exists. The lesson highlights the interconnectedness of artistic expression, demonstrating how the known paves the way for the new. The sculptures therefore represent a creative process and mindset, rather than being pieces of art alone.

 In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).

Susan Sontag was a towering intellectual figure of the 20th century, known for her powerful essays that transformed our understanding of various cultural phenomena. Writing from her influential position in cosmopolitan society, surrounded by literature and knowledge, she redefined our comprehension of concepts like camp, photography, and illness, establishing herself as an iconic brilliant thinker. However, as her editor Benjamin Taylor notes in his introduction to this collection, Sontag wasn't primarily dedicated to short-story writing. She utilized this format to escape what Chekhov termed ""autobiographophobia,"" the reluctance to directly examine and document one's personal experiences in writing. Interestingly, half of her ""stories"" are actually straightforward autobiographical accounts rather than fiction.

* The opening piece, ""Pilgrimage,"" exemplifies this blurred boundary, functioning as a memoir about Sontag's youth in Southern California and her underwhelming meeting with an aging Thomas Mann. This encounter remained a story rather than an essay largely because its disappointing nature made analysis challenging—Mann offered only conventional wisdom while Sontag remained awkwardly silent despite her complex inner thoughts.

* The subsequent work, ""Project for a Trip to China,"" continues in autobiographical mode, revealing additional details about Sontag's childhood, including her voracious reading habits and peculiar tendency to dig garden holes to sit in. This piece employs experimental techniques such as lists, tables, unnamed characters identified only by initials, and extensive use of negation, culminating in the predictable non-occurrence of the planned China journey.","Susan Sontag’s essays resonated with a voice that many have come to regard as one of the most influential of the past century. Her writing emanated from a creative hub in the heart of a sprawling metropolis. She demonstrated a profound connection with the subjects she explored, including camp, photography, and illness. Her work consistently revealed a blend of intellectual rigor and stylish cool. Despite her legendary status, Sontag was not primarily recognized as a short-story writer. Instead, she experimented with the form as a means of avoiding what Chekhov described as an intense fear of autobiographical reflection. Her editor, Benjamin Taylor, notes that her experimentation with short stories was a deliberate strategy. Taylor explains that she preferred to use the term “stories” as a way to subtly disguise personal memoir.  
 
For example, the piece titled “Pilgrimage” recounts her formative years spent in southern California and a rather unremarkable encounter with an eminent writer. In that memoir, Sontag reflects on a meeting with Thomas Mann which left her both disappointed and speechless.  
* This experience, filled with muted emotions, greatly influenced her narrative style.  
* Her experimental techniques include the use of lists and tables, with characters identified only by initials.  
She also touches on her adventurous dining habits as a young woman and offers insights into her family background, including her father’s work overseas. Her writing is marked by creative experiments with structure, incorporating numerous negations and a sense of playful reluctance. Overall, her work delicately balances personal experience with artistic innovation.","Susan Sontag, a prominent voice of the previous century, utilized her intellectual prowess to redefine our understanding of various cultural phenomena. Her editor, Benjamin Taylor, notes that while Sontag was not primarily a short-story writer, she employed the form to circumvent a reluctance to directly address her own life experiences. Sontag strategically labeled these autobiographical pieces as ""stories,"" finding the designation beneficial in navigating her personal narratives.

The collection begins with ""Pilgrimage,"" a memoir detailing Sontag's early life in Southern California. It recounts a visit to Thomas Mann's residence with a boyfriend. This encounter, however, proved anticlimactic, hindering Sontag's ability to extract profound reflections from the experience. Mann offered only cliché pronouncements, while Sontag struggled to articulate her complex emotions. The piece's classification as a story, rather than an essay, seems to stem from the challenges encountered in transforming the disappointing encounter into meaningful contemplation.

*   ""Project for a Trip to China,"" the subsequent piece, delves further into Sontag's personal history, revealing details about her childhood.

*   It highlights her insatiable appetite for reading, her peculiar habit of creating garden excavations, and provides glimpses into her father's work in China.

This particular piece adopts a more experimental approach, employing lists, tables, and anonymous characters. It also incorporates elements of negation, reflecting the fact that Sontag never actually made the journey to China. Furthermore, her tendency to order exotic foods while in restaurants is mentioned. The combination of autobiographical elements and experimental techniques creates a unique narrative structure. The rationale behind labeling the piece as a story is that it provided Sontag with the freedom to explore her personal history without the constraints of traditional memoir writing.

 To non-vegans, the idea of a plant-based Christmas dinner may smack of Scrooge crouched over a miserly candle, sucking on a single slice of tofu. There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what’s left? Actually, this year there’s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it’s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the “flexitarian” means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it’s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there’s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made – use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you’re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range’s new “roast beef” joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry’s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky’s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing.

Non-vegans might imagine a plant-based Christmas dinner as a sad affair, but there are now many options for vegans to indulge during the holidays. With the British vegetarian population ranging from 2-12%, supermarkets have expanded their meatless offerings. The rise of ""flexitarians"" has also encouraged retailers to provide more vegan options that even non-vegans might try. Although finding these products requires visiting several stores or shopping online, the effort yields a wide variety of choices. Most components of a traditional roast dinner are already vegan or can be easily adapted—potatoes can be roasted in oil instead of fat, olive oil can replace butter in mashed potatoes, and maple or agave syrup can substitute for honey on vegetables. For the main dish, options range from Linda McCartney's ""roast beef"" with red wine glaze (which has a remarkably authentic meat flavor) to Fry's soy and quinoa Country Roast or Tofurky's turkey and stuffing alternative. These centerpieces vary in how closely they resemble meat, catering to different preferences within the vegan community. Any other questions?","<<Vegan Yuletide Innovations>>

Non-vegans might initially view a plant-based Christmas feast with skepticism, imagining a sparse meal that sacrifices traditional indulgence. Yet during this festive period known for overindulgence, eliminating meat and dairy does not mean sacrificing flavor. Supermarkets are embracing this trend and offering an impressive range of vegan options for those looking to celebrate without animal products. With reports suggesting that a small but growing percentage of Britons follow vegetarian diets, shops have responded with an appealing selection for meat-free festivities. The rising popularity of flexitarianism means that even those who do not strictly adhere to vegan principles are exploring these alternatives. A typical Christmas roast largely aligns with vegan ingredients, although minor adjustments in preparation are necessary; for example, using oil for roasting potatoes and opting for olive oil in the mash instead of cream-based ingredients. The choice of main course depends on the effort a home cook is willing to invest, with options ranging from a robust ""roast beef"" imitation complete with a red wine glaze to hearty herby roasts. These creative substitutes allow both vegans and others to enjoy a satisfying festive meal. Any other questions?","<<Vegan Christmas Feast Options Abound>>

Many meat-eaters might think of a plant-based Christmas dinner as a sparse, joyless meal. Christmas typically involves indulging in rich, non-vegan foods. However, supermarkets are recognizing the growing number of vegans who also want festive feasts. With a significant percentage of the British population embracing vegetarian or flexitarian diets, stores now offer many vegan options. Creating a delicious vegan Christmas dinner requires some shopping around, but a wide range of choices is available. A traditional Christmas roast is mostly vegan already. Simple changes, like using oil instead of fat for roasting and olive oil instead of butter in mash, can easily make it fully vegan. For the main course, options range based on desired effort. Linda McCartney offers a beef-like joint with red wine glaze, appealing to those who enjoy meat flavors without the ethical concerns.

 “Travelling,” historian Norman Davies writes near the end of this enthralling book, “had allowed me to think freely about the subject I have spent most of my life studying.” From the journeys described in these pages he has confected a fragrant stew of history, literature and travel spiced with digression, detective work and dabs of humour. A distinguished academic whose many books include the bestselling Europe: A History, Davies’s itinerary “was not dictated by any principle other than keeping on the move in the general direction of the sunrise”. Twelve of the 16 chapters focus on a place – these range from Baku in Azerbaijan, where Asia and Europe overlap, to Cornwall. Four chapters are thematic. Davies’s goal, he said, was roughly akin to that of Goethe’s “school of seeing”: “To test my powers of observation, to spot the recurring themes and catch the fleeting details. And then to tell the story.” His themes include the history, and subsequent marginalisation, of indigenous peoples. The sections on the first inhabitants of Tasmania are particularly gripping. Linguistic revival and language in general fascinate this author, too.

The result is a rich mixture of historical exploration, literary references, and travel experiences, enhanced with thoughtful digressions, investigative scholarship, and touches of wit. As a renowned academic known for bestsellers like ""Europe: A History,"" Davies embarked on journeys with no particular agenda except moving ""in the general direction of the sunrise.""

The book primarily examines twelve specific locations, ranging from Baku in Azerbaijan—where European and Asian influences converge—to Cornwall in England. Four additional chapters explore broader themes. Davies explains his purpose was similar to Goethe's ""school of seeing"": he wanted to challenge his observational skills, identify recurring patterns, notice fleeting details, and ultimately craft a narrative from these experiences.

Among his recurring interests is the history of indigenous populations and their subsequent marginalization by dominant cultures. His account of Tasmania's original inhabitants proves particularly engaging. Davies also demonstrates a deep fascination with language revival movements and linguistic phenomena in general.

His exploration of language extends to using Chinese characters and Japanese kanji to better understand place names in those regions.

 The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government’s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.

Paragraph 1 must start with word technology.",paraphrase,"Technology has not been the focus of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's recent speech to the Business Council of Australia, where he surprisingly mentioned potential income tax cuts. This statement should be approached with caution until he provides details on how these cuts would be funded. Given that the projected return to budget surplus relies heavily on income tax revenue, implementing tax reductions before the next decade would likely require either increasing other taxes or significantly reducing government services.

During his address filled with typical free-market rhetoric, Turnbull mentioned working with the treasurer and cabinet to reduce the burden on middle-income Australians while still achieving the government's commitment to restore budget surplus. This announcement comes as somewhat unexpected considering the current fiscal situation, where surplus is only projected for 2020-21, at which point net debt is expected to reach $366 billion, representing 17.6% of GDP.

Promising tax cuts while operating in deficit appears to be a bold move for a political party that emphasizes budget responsibility. This becomes even more challenging when considering that the pathway back to surplus is fundamentally dependent on income tax revenue. Individual income tax has consistently been the largest source of taxation in the budget. While its relative importance decreased slightly during the mining boom years as corporate tax revenues grew substantially, individual income tax currently accounts for more than half of all tax revenue collected.

This heavy reliance on income tax presents a significant challenge, one that both the International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have advised Australia to address. However, this dependency creates an even greater dilemma for Turnbull's simultaneous commitments to tax reduction and budget restoration. The government's fiscal projections reveal that of the additional $88.1 billion in tax revenue anticipated between now and 2020-21, $48.5 billion is expected to come from individual income taxes.

The implications of these figures demonstrate that income tax is shouldering a disproportionate burden of the projected revenue increase. While income tax constitutes 50.6% of total tax revenue, it accounts for approximately 55% of the expected growth in tax revenue through 2020-21. This imbalance makes Turnbull's dual commitment to tax cuts and budget surplus particularly difficult to reconcile without significant adjustments to other aspects of fiscal policy.","technology marks an unexpected twist in the prime minister’s recent address to the Business Council of Australia, where he hinted at additional income tax cuts without offering corresponding details on how these reductions would be financed. In his speech, he referenced the government’s ongoing efforts to lighten the tax load on middle-income earners while maintaining a commitment to eventually achieve a budget surplus. This early mention of tax cuts appears somewhat premature given the current fiscal landscape, which is heavily reliant on individual income tax revenues. The government's strategy for reaching a surplus involves an intricate balance; any reduction in income tax would necessitate either a rise in other forms of taxation or significant cuts in public services, thus provoking critical debates among political commentators.

The announcement took many observers by surprise, as it came against the backdrop of a projected timetable that sees a return to a surplus only in the fiscal years 2020-21. With national debt reaching substantial figures relative to the country’s gross domestic product, the forward-looking promise of tax cuts seems audacious. The commentary draws attention to the irony of advocating for tax reductions at a time when balancing the budget is already a formidable challenge. The prime minister’s remarks were delivered amidst his standard celebration of free markets and economic optimism, yet his words also exposed an inherent contradiction in planning additional tax cuts while relying on income tax revenue as a cornerstone of fiscal consolidation.

Examining the budget’s details reveals that individual income tax contributes slightly more than half of the overall tax revenue. Yet, it also accounts for a disproportionate share of the planned revenue increase—an extra $88.1 billion—with a significant fraction stemming directly from personal income tax collections. This dynamic raises concerns about the sustainability of such a fiscal framework. Financial experts and international organizations have previously suggested that the nation should consider diversifying its revenue sources to mitigate the risks associated with overreliance on this single tax.

The prime minister’s approach represents a politically bold maneuver, trying to walk a tightrope between fiscal responsibility and tax relief for middle-income households. This approach has ignited a debate among economists and political analysts alike, highlighting the delicate balance required in managing national finances in a volatile economic climate. While the agenda is rooted in the objective of fostering a stronger, surplus-based fiscal policy, doubts remain about the long-term feasibilities of such strategies given the current fiscal architecture.","Technology and innovation are not included in this particular piece; thus, the analysis focuses on the economic and political aspects. The Prime Minister's recent remarks to the Business Council of Australia regarding the government's intention to pursue further income tax reductions should be viewed with skepticism unless accompanied by a clear explanation of how these cuts will be financed. Given that the projected return to a budget surplus relies heavily on income tax revenue, any reduction in income tax is unlikely to occur before the next decade without either raising other taxes or significantly reducing government services. The Prime Minister's statement is particularly surprising given the current budgetary situation, which projects a return to surplus only in 2020-21 and a net debt of $366 billion, or 17.6% of GDP, at that time.

Even under favorable economic conditions, promising income tax cuts while the budget is in deficit is a bold move for a political group that prides itself on ""budget responsibility."" This is especially true when the path back to surplus depends on income tax revenue. Individual income tax has historically been the largest source of tax revenue in the budget. While its importance declined somewhat during the mining boom as corporate tax revenues surged, individual income tax currently accounts for just over half of all tax revenue.

This dependence on income tax is problematic, as international organizations like the IMF and OECD have urged Australia to diversify its tax base. However, it poses an even greater challenge for the Prime Minister's call for tax cuts while simultaneously aiming to ""meet our commitment to return the budget to surplus."" The issue lies in the fact that of the additional $88.1 billion in tax revenue that the government expects to generate between now and 2020-21, $48.5 billion is projected to come from individual income tax.

This indicates that income tax is bearing a disproportionate share of the increase in tax revenue. While income tax constitutes 50.6% of total tax revenue, it accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21. The government's reliance on increased income tax revenue to achieve a budget surplus makes the prospect of income tax cuts before 2020-21 difficult to believe.

The article expresses doubt that the government is able to cut taxes because the surplus is based on income tax revenue. Cutting income taxes would likely be contradictory to the government's aims to return the budget to surplus. A surplus would be even more unattainable should income tax revenue lessen, which is the main source of the budget increasing.

 Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.

Mead wasn't publicly linked to the Wright family until she contested her father's will, claiming it didn't adequately provide for her needs. She had initially been left a $3m trust fund accessible at age 30, with conditions that she avoid alcoholism, criminal convictions, drug associations, and non-traditional Christian faiths.

In early 2015, the supreme court ruled in Mead's favor, increasing her inheritance to $25m. However, Wright's estate, representing his older children, appealed. The Western Australian supreme court has now ruled that while Mead was inadequately provided for originally, the $25m award was excessive.

The court determined that several errors were made in calculating the inheritance, stating that the amount should allow her to purchase a substantial house and invest the remainder to produce a lifetime annuity.

At 22, she is the youngest daughter of Perth mining magnate Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late mining figure, Lang Hancock.

Originally, she was set to receive a $3m trust fund accessible at 30, provided she avoided alcoholism, criminal behavior, involvement with illicit drugs, or conversion from traditional Christianity. In early 2015, a supreme court judgement sided with her, multiplying her share eight-fold to $25m—a sum described as within what many in the community might reasonably expect. Despite her team revising her claim downward from $20m to $12m, an appeal by the estate representing her older half-siblings led the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court to later overturn that decision, stating that calculating her provision as $25m was flawed.

Initially, she was to receive a $3 million trust fund with strict conditions relating to lifestyle choices.

A court initially sided with Mead, increasing her inheritance substantially. However, Wright's estate, representing his older children, appealed. The court overturned the prior decision, stating that while Mead was initially under-provided for, the initial sum awarded was excessive.

The appeal judges determined that the previous court had made errors in calculating Mead's inheritance, emphasizing that the correct measurement was the ""proper maintenance"" that she was owed.

 As the Queensland election campaign heads into its final stretch, Labor’s main message of “chaos” under a Liberal National party-One Nation government has been damaged by one of its own, while Adani continues to cause headaches for both major parties. With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats. Labor has consolidated its message to one line – “a clear choice” – as it seeks to highlight what it says will be the “cuts and chaos” under a Tim Nicholls-led government. The LNP leader has said he is willing to work with One Nation in the event of a hung parliament. But the Labor campaign is reeling from the damage done by one of its own MPs, the former police minister Jo-Ann Miller, who sought out the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, in front of the media on Tuesday, embracing her and presenting her with a gift for her new grandson. Media at the event have reported that One Nation was aware of Miller’s intentions. Miller and Labor have maintained it was a coincidence of the campaign and a “common decency” to present a gift for a new baby. But the friendly meeting may have damaged Labor’s attempts to paint itself as standing apart from Hanson’s party, which is predicted to take seats across north and central Queensland, as well as some outer-urban electorates in the south-east. “The real issue here is what is going to happen in three days’ time, on Saturday,” Annastacia Palaszczuk said from Bundaberg on Wednesday, moments before her team attempted to keep her away from signs declaring: “It’ll be grim under Tim.” The placement of “grim” seemed a little too close for comfort for those focused on optics. “That is the real fundamental issue and it is about a choice, it is fundamentally about a clear choice,” she said.

With voting day on Saturday approaching, neither party has emerged as a clear frontrunner, causing both Labor and LNP to scramble for support in key seats.

Labor has simplified its message to emphasize a 'clear choice' for voters, warning of 'cuts and chaos' under Tim Nicholls' leadership, particularly noting his willingness to work with One Nation if there's a hung parliament. However, the Labor campaign was blindsided when former police minister Jo-Ann Miller publicly embraced One Nation leader Pauline Hanson and gave her a gift for her grandson, an encounter that media reports suggest was planned by One Nation.

While Miller and Labor have dismissed the interaction as coincidental and simply showing 'common decency,' the friendly meeting potentially undermines Labor's strategy of distancing itself from Hanson's party, which is expected to win seats across Queensland's north, central regions, and some outer-urban areas in the southeast. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk tried to refocus attention on the upcoming election while in Bundaberg Wednesday, even as her team attempted to shield her from awkwardly placed campaign signs reading 'It'll be grim under Tim.'

Hall marks of the campaign's final stretch include Palaszczuk's emphasis on the 'fundamental issue' of voters having a 'clear choice' when they head to the polls, while both major parties continue to navigate challenges including the Adani controversy and the potential influence of One Nation in the election's outcome.""","""Across Queensland's heated election campaign, the final stretch has intensified as both sides scramble for every advantage. Labor’s central claim that a government coalition between the Liberal National Party and One Nation would lead to instability has been compromised by actions from within its own ranks, all while ongoing controversies surrounding Adani continue to create turmoil for both major parties.

With voters set to cast their ballots on Saturday, neither Labor nor the LNP has yet secured a commanding lead, forcing both parties to aggressively target key electorates. Labor has honed its message down to a simple proposition—a clear choice—emphasizing what it describes as the disorder and budget cuts expected under a Tim Nicholls-led government.

The campaign has suffered further when former police minister Jo-Ann Miller, a Labor MP, was seen warmly welcoming and gifting One Nation leader Pauline Hanson for the celebration of her new grandson. While both Miller and Labor maintain that the encounter was an accidental display of common decency, media reports indicate that Hanson may have been informed of Miller’s intentions beforehand, potentially weakening Labor’s efforts to draw a clear distinction with One Nation.

hall, analysts note that timing is crucial as the final days approach, with both sides maneuvering in electorates across north and central Queensland and in some outer-urban areas of the southeast. Annastacia Palaszczuk, speaking from Bundaberg just before her team intervened to remove a sign reading 'It’ll be grim under Tim', stressed that the key issue remains ensuring voters are presented with a decisive, unmistakable choice at the ballot box.""","""As the Queensland election nears its end, Labor's strategy of portraying a Liberal National party-One Nation coalition as chaotic has been undermined by a Labor MP. Meanwhile, the Adani issue remains a problem for both major parties. With the election just days away, neither the LNP nor Labor has a clear lead, and both are struggling to secure seats.

Labor is focusing its message on presenting voters with ""a clear choice,"" emphasizing the potential ""cuts and chaos"" under a government led by Tim Nicholls. The LNP leader has stated his willingness to collaborate with One Nation if no party wins a majority. However, Labor's campaign has been hurt by Jo-Ann Miller, a former police minister, who publicly greeted One Nation leader Pauline Hanson with an embrace and a gift for her grandson.

 Forget Bennelong or New England, the battle for Australia’s favourite bird is on. As the inaugural bird of the year poll launched on Monday, the nation’s celebrities, political leaders and media outlets immediately began their campaigns. The divisive Australian white ibis leapt to a commanding lead and the powerful owl, with the aid of Russian hackers, rose up the ranks. But in a crowded field of diverse native birds, endorsements rang out for nearly all contenders. The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, cut his ties to the magpie, currently coming second, and set his sights on the emu (whose image sits above Parliament House), in what must surely be an early election pitch. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, chose the Gang-gang cockatoo, another Canberra icon (“Incredible plumage but it sounds like a rusty door”), while fellow senator Nick McKim picked the wedge-tailed eagle, and Janet Rice, the hooded plover. Scott Ludlam, 2017’s first dual citizen, again displayed divided loyalties. The former senator endorsed the Carnaby’s black cockatoo at 3.45pm on Monday, but by 8.30pm, he suddenly declared himself “Team Bin Chicken”. Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, was asked but did not respond, opening himself up to a string of less-than-flattering replies. But the government’s leader of the house, Christopher Pyne, did tell ABC Radio’s Patricia Karvelas he liked the black-faced spoonbill.

The Australian white ibis quickly secured a substantial lead, while the powerful owl climbed the rankings amid jokes about Russian interference. The contest revealed diverse preferences among political figures: Opposition Leader Bill Shorten abandoned the magpie to support the emu, which appears on Parliament House; Greens Leader Richard Di Natale championed the Gang-gang cockatoo; Senator Nick McKim advocated for the wedge-tailed eagle; and Janet Rice backed the hooded plover. Former Senator Scott Ludlam showed changing allegiances, initially supporting the Carnaby's black cockatoo before switching to ""Team Bin Chicken."" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's silence prompted numerous unfavorable responses, while House Leader Christopher Pyne expressed his fondness for the black-faced spoonbill.","<<Australian Icon Showdown>>

The race to crown Australia’s top bird has sparked a frenzy among celebrities, political figures, and media following the launch of the first-ever bird of the year poll on Monday. While the controversial Australian white ibis surged ahead and the powerful owl benefited from unexpected online boosts, nearly every native species found support from various endorsers. Opposition leader Bill Shorten shifted his backing from the magpie—once a strong contender—to the emu, echoing political ambitions, whereas Greens leader Richard Di Natale rallied for the Gang-gang cockatoo. Senator Nick McKim and Janet Rice put forth the wedge-tailed eagle and the hooded plover, respectively, and Scott Ludlam, known for his dual citizenship, demonstrated shifting loyalties by initially supporting the Carnaby’s black cockatoo before later aligning himself with ""Team Bin Chicken."" Although Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull remained silent amid mounting criticism, the government's leader in the house, Christopher Pyne, expressed a fondness for the black-faced spoonbill.","<<Australian Bird of the Year Competition Heats Up>>

Australia has launched its first ""Bird of the Year"" poll, sparking immediate and enthusiastic campaigning from prominent figures. The Australian white ibis quickly took the lead, while the powerful owl gained traction with suspected external influence. Politicians and media personalities are publicly endorsing their favorite native birds from across the nation. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten switched his support from the magpie to the emu, and Greens leader Richard Di Natale is backing the Gang-gang cockatoo. Other senators are championing birds such as the wedge-tailed eagle and the hooded plover. Former senator Scott Ludlam even switched allegiances mid-campaign, embracing the ibis. While the Prime Minister remained silent, another government member voiced his preference for the black-faced spoonbill.

 Top story: ‘Hard job but he makes it harder for himself’ Hello – it’s Warren Murray with the news in a nutshell. Philip Hammond is in a “make or break” position as he delivers the autumn budget today, senior Tories have warned. The chancellor of the exchequer is under pressure from Brexiters to make leaving the EU sound like a good thing, while winning back voters by improving housing affordability, boosting education, increasing NHS funding and easing the public sector pay freeze. Rafael Behr sums up Hammond’s predicament: “He must build houses, but not in anyone’s backyard. He must raise revenue, but not from taxes.” Hammond’s March budget was overshadowed by a failed attempt to increase national insurance for the self-employed; and this time around, saying on national television that there are no unemployed people in Britain has not helped his cause. “He’s got a hard job but the way he deals with it makes it harder for himself,” said one Conservative source.

 Here is a portrait of the primatologist as a young woman. Using footage only recently rediscovered in the National Geographic archive, octogenarian Jane Goodall recollects her first field study of chimpanzees in the wild in Tanzania. This was the 1960s, and Goodall was a 26-year-old typist with no academic training. Yet on that trip she made a great leap in scientific research by observing chimps making and using tools. Goodall says that it was her mother who built her self-esteem when she was growing up – encouraging her to see beyond the expectations that a nice, middle-class girl from Bournemouth should get married and start a family. Instead, she dreamed of living with animals in the jungle like Tarzan. There are more than 40 documentaries about Goodall. What makes this one – directed by Brett Morgen, who made The Kid Stays in the Picture – essential, is Goodall’s reflective mood and the wondrous 16mm archive footage shot by Hugo van Lawick, the great wildlife photographer National Geographic sent to film her in Tanzania. The pair fell in love and married (though in the end, Goodall’s happy-ever-after was with the chimps not Van Lawick). One of his miraculous shots, of the annual great migration from Serengeti – a medley of animals gathered together like some majestic parliament of beasts – drew a gasp of wonder from a gentleman sitting behind me.

 What does it mean when dancers express emotion on stage? Do they bring real-life experiences to those highly choreographed moments when they’re leaping with ecstasy, racked by grief or, as in the climax of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, dancing themselves to death on behalf of a fearful, threatened community? These are some of the questions posed by Goat, the raw, funny and occasionally searing new piece of dance theatre that Ben Duke has made for Rambert. The setting is an ambiguous space that is part meeting hall, part performance arena, and its “characters” are a group of dancers and musicians who have gathered to enact some kind of cathartic emotional ritual. Miguel Altunaga plays a reporter sent to describe it, and the tone at first is wickedly funny as Altunaga – a pitch perfect combination of intrusive and bewildered – tries to make sense of what’s happening. “Amazing energy,” he pronounces as the group rock through a happy-clappy ensemble. Then as the group divide into individual solos, contorting their bodies into expressions of private feeling, he trails after the dancers, hoping for elucidation. One of them, her limbs tied into an agonised knot, explains breathlessly that she’s dancing about the “stigma of addiction”. Another, his eyes rolling back in his head with exertion, says he’s expressing a sense of betrayal. It’s a brilliant riff on the worst cliches of interpretative modern dance but Duke is soon flipping the work into something deeper, darker and more personal.

Section 1
This article talks about a new dance show called ""Goat"" by Ben Duke for the Rambert dance company. The show explores how dancers express emotions on stage - do they use real personal feelings when they dance with joy or sadness? The performance takes place in a space that feels like both a community hall and a stage, where the dancers perform an emotional ritual. This show is like reading an open file of human emotions displayed through movement.

Section 2
A character named Miguel Altunaga plays a reporter who's watching and trying to understand the performance. At first, the show is quite funny. The reporter uses phrases like ""amazing energy"" while watching dancers in group movements. He's trying to use the performance as a tool to understand human expression, but seems confused by what he's seeing.

Section 3
The dancers then split up and do individual performances, each expressing different feelings through their body movements. One dancer contorts her body in a painful-looking way and explains she's portraying addiction struggles. Another dancer, with eyes rolling back from effort, says he's expressing feelings of betrayal. The article suggests these explanations are like a message that pokes fun at some clichés in modern dance.

Section 4
The article describes how the performance starts out being funny and satirical but then changes into something more serious and personal. It's like watching a garden of emotions grow from something playful into something more profound and meaningful. The choreographer Ben Duke deliberately takes the audience from laughter to deeper reflection.

Section 5
Overall, this text is reviewing a dance performance that questions how authentic emotions are in dance. It examines whether dancers really feel what they portray or if it's all just choreographed movement. The outcome of this approach is a performance that begins with humor but evolves into something more thought-provoking about how we express and share our genuine emotions through art.","Section 1  
The article talks about a new dance theatre piece called Goat. It asks what it means when dancers show strong emotions on stage. The writer is trying to understand whether the feelings they display come from real life, like deep personal pain or joy, much like a file that holds records of genuine thoughts.

Section 2  
In the performance, the stage is used like a garden where different elements grow together. The space is not just a regular stage but a mix between a meeting hall and an arena, and the dancers and musicians are like seeds planted in a garden that bloom with energy and emotion.

Section 3  
A reporter character in the piece acts as a tool to help the audience understand the performance. He watches the group with a mix of humor and curiosity, trying to read the message behind the dancing. His role is to observe and share his understanding of the unusual actions unfolding on stage.

Section 4  
After watching group dances filled with cheerful energy, the performance shifts to individual solos. Here, the dancers use their bodies to express intense personal feelings like pain or betrayal. These scenes use dance as a tool for sharing personal struggles and turning common ideas into something more meaningful, much like turning a written file into a vivid picture.

Section 5  
In summary, the piece uses dance to explore deep emotions and social issues, challenging the audience to look beyond simple interpretations. The performance delivers a complex message about life, love, and loss. The outcome is a thought-provoking experience that blends humor with deeper, darker themes, much like a conversation in a serene garden that unexpectedly turns into a profound revelation.","Okay, here's a simplified explanation of the Guardian article excerpt, broken down into five sections and incorporating the specified keywords:

Section 1
The article introduces a new dance theatre piece called ""Goat"" by Ben Duke for Rambert. The piece explores the question of how dancers portray emotion on stage. Does their performance reflect real-life experiences, or is it purely choreographed? The setting is designed to be unclear. It is like a meeting hall and performance space. The outcome is unclear, will the cathartic ritual be successful?

Section 2
The piece features dancers and musicians participating in a cathartic ritual – a way to release strong emotions. A reporter, played by Miguel Altunaga, is there to document it. Initially, the tone is satirical. The reporter is confused but impressed, using phrases like ""amazing energy.""

Section 3
As the dance progresses, the reporter tries to understand the individual dancers' expressions. They offer explanations for their movements, often using clichés associated with modern dance, like expressing the ""stigma of addiction"" or ""a sense of betrayal."" This is done in a humorous way, highlighting the absurdity of overly literal interpretations of dance.

Section 4
The article suggests that the initial humor is a tool used by Ben Duke. But the performance is designed to shift into something more serious. A file with the cliches in it has been opened and examined by the choreographer, and now a new file is to be opened that contains something deeper and more personal.

Section 5
The overall message is that ""Goat"" uses humor to engage with the complex topic of emotional expression in dance, but it promises to evolve into a more profound and individual exploration of feeling. The ambiguous garden of emotion is explored through the dance.

 Ministers have sought to see off a potential rebellion by Conservative MPs that could have brought a first defeat over the EU withdrawal bill by partially backing down on the future status of EU human rights measures in UK law. Following another day of debate about the bill, which seeks to transpose EU statute into UK law post-Brexit, the government faced possible defeat over amendments intended to maintain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. Several of the amendments were tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general and a leading Brexit rebel, with speculation that enough of his fellow Tories would back some of these to inflict defeat. However, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, said the government was willing to work with Grieve to see how rights under the charter could be kept after Brexit, and would introduce its own amendment to this effect later in the bill’s passage. Grieve said this was sufficient reassurance for him and that he would not press for a vote on his amendments. Ken Clarke, another leading Conservative Brexit rebel, refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote on one amendment, which would allow Britons to mount legal challenges under the charter after Brexit, to which he was the second signatory after Grieve. However, with Grieve backing away, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened if a vote was called. Buckland said he did not fully agree with Grieve’s amendment, which would allow challenges to EU law retained after Brexit “on the grounds that it is in breach of general principles of EU law”, and questioned whether it would add anything “that is relevant or material” to existing rights. But Buckland said: “Let me say that we do recognise the strength of views from my right honourable friend and, indeed, from other honourable members and honourable friends on this issue – many of whom have spoken this afternoon. “We’re listening, and we are prepared to look again at this issue to make sure that we are taking an approach that can command the support of this house.” Buckland said he would happily discuss a way forward with Grieve, “and agree to work together with us in this shared endeavour”, which would result in a government amendment in the report stage, the next part of the bill’s passage through the Commons.

Section 1
This news article is about a situation in the UK Parliament regarding the EU withdrawal bill (Brexit legislation). Conservative MPs (members of the Prime Minister's own party) were considering rebelling by supporting amendments to the bill, specifically about keeping EU human rights protections (the EU charter on fundamental rights) in UK law after Brexit. 

Section 2
The government feared they might lose a vote on these amendments, so they compromised. The solicitor general (Robert Buckland) promised to work with the main rebel, Dominic Grieve, to create a new government amendment later in the process that would address concerns about maintaining rights currently protected by EU law. Because of this promise, Grieve decided not to push for a vote on his amendments, which reduced the risk of the government being defeated.

<<Simpler Explanation>>  

Section 2  
The article explains that government ministers were trying to prevent a rebellion by some Conservative MPs over a Brexit-related bill. Some MPs, notably Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke, wanted to keep more EU human rights protections in UK law after Brexit. To avoid the risk of defeat when the bill was voted on, the government decided to compromise by agreeing to review and possibly adjust the proposals on human rights protections later in the process. This move helped ease some of the concerns among the rebellious MPs.

Section 1
The government was facing a potential defeat in Parliament over the EU withdrawal bill. Some Conservative MPs, led by Dominic Grieve, were unhappy with how the bill handled EU human rights laws after Brexit and proposed amendments to strengthen those protections.

Section 2
To avoid defeat, the government offered a compromise. They agreed to work with Grieve to find a way to keep some of the EU charter on fundamental rights in UK law after Brexit. In return, Grieve said he wouldn't push for a vote on his amendments. However, another rebel MP, Ken Clarke, might still push for a vote on a similar amendment. The government thinks Grieve's plan is unnecessary but is willing to discuss it.

* The government is trying to avoid a defeat by appeasing rebel MPs who want to maintain EU human rights laws after Brexit.

P.S. The situation is complex and could still change.

Section 3
Essentially, the government is trying to navigate a tricky situation and avoid a political upset by offering concessions to those within their own party who are critical of their approach to Brexit. This could affect the final form of the EU withdrawal bill and the level of human rights protection available in the UK after Brexit.

 Amsterdam has won the right to become the new host for the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In a nail-biting final round last night, the 19 European cities that had put in bids had been whittled down to Milan and Amsterdam, sharing an equal number of votes. A draw from a hat sealed it for Amsterdam. Moments later, the same scenario played out for the European Banking Authority (EBA), with Paris and Dublin going into a hat and Paris being drawn. And so it is settled.

This news article is about how Amsterdam was chosen yesterday to be the new home for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) after Brexit. There was a tie between Amsterdam and Milan, so they had to pick the winner by drawing an object from a hat. Similarly, Paris won the right to host another branch of European authority called the European Banking Authority (EBA).

The EMA will move from London, taking with it almost 900 jobs and a budget of €322 million (a significant amount of currency). About 40,000 business visitors come to the EMA each year, which helps local businesses like hotels and restaurants.

The article raises the question of whether the UK will still follow EMA regulations after Brexit. The author suggests this is a major loss for the UK in terms of money, talent, and influence. The text explains that the EMA regulates medicines for the European single market, and now the UK must request new arrangements for medicine regulation after Brexit.","Please explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Include keywords ['branch', 'currency', 'object', 'request', 'yesterday'] in the response.

The article explains that Amsterdam has been selected as the new home for an important European organization, the European Medicines Agency (EMA). It says that in a vote between several European cities, Amsterdam tied with another candidate (Milan) and, much like drawing a random name from a hat yesterday, Amsterdam was chosen. Similarly, for another European organization, the European Banking Authority, a draw was used to decide between cities like Paris and Dublin, and Paris was selected. The move of the EMA is significant because it means a major branch of regulatory operations will leave the UK (particularly after Brexit), taking with it nearly 900 jobs and a large budget that acts like important currency for the local economy. This shift affects not only the direct jobs but also the whole support network (the object of many economic activities) that boosts local businesses. In short, the decision was made by a random request process, and it will have far-reaching impacts due to the interconnectedness of industries, finances, and regulatory roles across Europe.","The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.

 Amsterdam has won the right to become the new host for the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In a nail-biting final round last night, the 19 European cities that had put in bids had been whittled down to Milan and Amsterdam, sharing an equal number of votes. A draw from a hat sealed it for Amsterdam. Moments later, the same scenario played out for the European Banking Authority (EBA), with Paris and Dublin going into a hat and Paris being drawn. And so it is settled. The EMA will move from London to Amsterdam after Brexit – taking with it nearly 900 jobs, a budget of €322m, and some 40,000 business visits every year, which support local hotels, restaurants, taxis and so on. Also likely to move with the EMA is the attendant industry that congregates around it for easy access to the regulator. It’s a substantial loss of finances, talent, infrastructure and influence.

Okay, here's the simplified explanation:

Essentially, because of Brexit (the UK leaving the European Union), two important European agencies are relocating from London. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which approves medicines for the EU market, is moving to Amsterdam. The decision was made **yesterday** after a tie and a literally random draw (from a hat!). Similarly, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is moving to Paris, also decided by a draw.

This move is a big deal because the EMA brings a lot of jobs (900!), money (a €322m budget, that's the **currency**), and business to its host city. Companies associated with the EMA—basically the whole medicine industry—will also likely move. This is a financial loss for the UK. The article ends by asking if the UK will still participate in the EMA after it leaves. The EMA is the regulatory **branch** for medicines in the EU's single market. The movement of this **object** (the EMA) causes some to question whether the UK should **request** to leave.

This text is a collection of corrections published by The Guardian newspaper. They're fixing mistakes that appeared in previous editions. For example, they wrongly said tennis player Andy Murray missed a tournament because of knee problems, when it was actually a hip injury. They also made an error about marriage certificates, stating they only required fathers' names when that's only true in England and Wales, not all of the UK.

The corrections continue with a clarification about the EU referendum vote in Northern Ireland. The newspaper had reported it as 60% for ""remain,"" but the actual figure was 56%. This shows how newspapers track and correct even relatively small errors to maintain accuracy and credibility with their readers.

***

At the end, The Guardian mentions other articles they've recently corrected without giving details. These include stories about NHS operations being postponed, an obituary for Lord Hutchinson, and a case about university staff pay and conditions. This demonstrates their commitment to acknowledging and fixing mistakes across various types of news coverage.

P.S. This format of publishing corrections is standard practice in reputable newspapers to maintain transparency and accountability with readers.","The text provides a summary of several corrections made by the Guardian. It explains that some details in earlier articles were incorrect and have since been fixed. For example, the article about tennis player Andy Murray was corrected to show that his absence was due to a hip injury rather than his knee problems.

Another article was corrected regarding marriage certificates in the UK. It clarified that, in England and Wales, marriage certificates include only the names of the couple’s fathers and not their mothers. Additionally, a letter about the EU referendum in Northern Ireland was amended to change the remain vote figure from 60% to 56%.

Specifically, the first correction addresses an incorrect reason given for Andy Murray's absence from a tennis tournament. The article had stated it was due to a knee problem, but the actual reason was a hip injury. The second correction clarifies a detail about UK marriage certificates, stating that they only require fathers' names, which is true specifically for England and Wales, contrary to an earlier broader claim. The third correction rectifies a percentage figure regarding the ""remain"" vote in Northern Ireland during the EU referendum.

-------
 In 1612, a contemporary of Shakespeare’s, the playwright Thomas Heywood, published An Apology for Actors, in which he expressed a patriotic sentiment about the English language, boastful at the time, which now seems unexceptional: Our English tongue, which hath been the most harsh, uneven and broken language of the world... is now continually refined, every writer striving in himself to add a new flourish unto it; so that it is grown into a most perfect and composed language. The coming of age of English at the beginning of the 17th century, after a golden generation of extraordinary growth and innovation, is symbolised by the publication of a landmark edition that the playwright himself had never bothered with in his own lifetime. Indeed, it was not until seven years after his death, thanks to the First Folio, that his work began slowly to acquire the canonical status it enjoys today. Towards the end of November 1623, the bookseller Edward Blount, who traded at the sign of the Black Bear near St Paul’s, finally held in his hands the text of a great volume for which he had long been waiting: Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies. Published according to the True Originall Copies. In the words of one critic: “It is hard to overstate the importance of this literary, cultural and commercial moment.” The book now known as the First Folio (the first authoritative edition of Shakespeare’s plays) established “Shakespeare” for all time and it did this in two principal ways. First, it collects some 36 plays, including 18 scripts (notably Macbeth, Julius Caesar, As You Like It and The Tempest) which would be otherwise unknown. The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox). Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be “the soul of the age”) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of “Shakespeare studies”. Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare’s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books’ sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections).

This text is talking about the First Folio, which was the first complete collection of Shakespeare's plays, published in 1623, seven years after he died. The article explains why this book was so important:

In the early 1600s, English was becoming a more refined and respected language. Thomas Heywood, another playwright from Shakespeare's time, wrote about how English had improved from being a ""harsh, uneven"" language to a ""perfect and composed"" one.

The First Folio was a landmark publication that established Shakespeare's importance in literature forever. It contained 36 plays total, including 18 that might have been completely lost otherwise. Famous plays like ""Macbeth,"" ""Julius Caesar,"" and ""The Tempest"" were preserved because of this book. Shakespeare also introduced many new words to English through these works, such as ""catastrophe,"" ""assassinate,"" and ""paradox.""

The book included a famous portrait of Shakespeare that has become iconic, and it connected him with his contemporary Ben Jonson (who called Shakespeare ""the soul of the age"") and the actors who first performed his plays.

Today, the First Folio is extremely valuable - worth more than $5 million - and quite rare, with only about 240 copies still existing in collections around the world. The text emphasizes that this book was crucial in launching Shakespeare's global literary reputation and preserving his work for future generations to enjoy and study.","<<Shakespeare's First Folio and Its Significance>>

This passage explains a piece of history tied to the English language and William Shakespeare’s plays. In simple terms, it tells us that back in the early 1600s, English was seen as rough and unpolished, but writers like Thomas Heywood believed the language was improving and becoming more refined. Heywood, a contemporary of Shakespeare, wrote proudly about this change, even if his words now seem less surprising to us.

The text then shifts to explain the importance of a landmark book known as the First Folio. This book, published a few years after Shakespeare’s death, was a key moment in history because it collected about 36 of his plays. Many of these plays, such as Macbeth, Julius Caesar, As You Like It, and The Tempest, were printed for the first time and might have been lost forever without this compilation. Additionally, Shakespeare’s work not only introduced immortal characters like Bottom, Falstaff, and Lear but also enriched the English language with many new words, for example, “catastrophe,” “exaggerate,” and “assassinate.”

The First Folio also linked Shakespeare’s work with his contemporaries, like the actor-turned-poet Ben Jonson, and helped form the image of Shakespeare as both a person and a legend in literature. Finally, it notes that the First Folio is extremely rare and valuable today, with only around 240 copies remaining, some valued at more than $5 million each.","<<The Enduring Legacy of Shakespeare's First Folio>>

In 1612, Thomas Heywood, a playwright who lived around the same time as Shakespeare, wrote about how the English language was becoming more refined and sophisticated. This was a time of great progress and creativity in English literature. Shakespeare, although very well-known even then, did not care enough about literary legacy to publish his plays, but after Shakespeare's death, a very important book called the First Folio was published.

The First Folio was a collection of Shakespeare's plays that was published in 1623, seven years after his death. A bookseller named Edward Blount had been eagerly waiting to publish it. The First Folio is considered a turning point as it cemented Shakespeare's place in literary history for two key reasons.

First, it preserved 36 of his plays, including 18 that might have been lost forever. These included masterpieces like ""Macbeth"", ""Julius Caesar"", ""As You Like It"", and ""The Tempest."" This collection not only gave the world unforgettable characters such as Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, and Prospero but also introduced many new words into the English language, like ""catastrophe,"" ""exaggerate,"" ""assassinate,"" ""indifference,"" ""monopoly,"" and ""paradox.""

Second, the First Folio linked Shakespeare's plays to their historical context, connecting his contemporary Ben Jonson, who called Shakespeare ""the soul of the age,"" and the actors who originally performed the plays, with Shakespeare himself. The book included a portrait of Shakespeare, which has become a symbol of ""Shakespeare studies.""

The First Folio is highly valuable and quite rare, with only about 240 copies still existing today. This book played a crucial role in establishing Shakespeare's lasting fame and influence on literature, as well as on language itself.

 Ratko Mladić, the Serb warlord who terrorised Bosnia in the 1990s, was on Wednesday forcibly removed from court after a shouting outburst delayed the reading of the verdict in his trial for the last genocide committed in Europe. The long-anticipated verdict was previously delayed for half an hour after Mladic asked the judge if he could take a short bathroom break. The delay was extended as rumours began to circulate that the former Bosnian Serb commander, who had appeared healthy when sitting in court, had suddenly been taken ill. As he entered the ICTY courtroom, Mladic had infuriated relatives of the victims as gave a broad smile and gave a thumbs up to the cameras. Mladić, who was commander of the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and for several years was one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, is now 74 and in poor health. His lawyers have argued he is not well enough to hear his verdict and sentence in person, but it is not clear whether they will seek a last-minute postponement. A judge has already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the judgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladić is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karadžić, was convicted of genocide last year for his role in the Srebrenica killings.

 Fresh detail has emerged from the investigation into whether Vote Leave breached a £7m spending limit during the referendum campaign by donating £625,000 to a fashion student. The Electoral Commission has noted, in documents seen by the Guardian, that Darren Grimes, who was 23 at the time, was apparently able to coordinate large sums to be spent with a social media marketing firm before receiving official confirmation of the amounts Vote Leave were intending to give him. Vote Leave, Grimes and a third group, Veterans for Britain, are under investigation by the election regulator over referendum spending. It was not against election rules for Vote Leave to donate to Grimes or other third parties as long as the spending was not coordinated. The watchdog reopened its investigation after an early decision not to take action was due to be challenged in a judicial review next month. A document submitted by the commission as part of the review process reveals the relationship between Vote Leave and Grimes. It describes how Grimes told Vote Leave on 13 June last year he would like to use a donation offered at an unknown date the previous week on a digital campaign with Aggregate IQ. The referendum was held 10 days later. Vote Leave told Grimes on 14 June that it had decided to donate £400,000 to him, the day after Vote Leave itself received a £1m donation, and Grimes provided his AIQ reference number for the payment to be made directly. “It appears Mr Grimes was in a position to make arrangements with AIQ to provide services to him on 13 June ... before receiving confirmation of the amount to be donated,” the review said.

The Electoral Commission, which oversees election rules, is investigating whether this was a way to get around the £7m total spending limit. The key issue is whether Vote Leave coordinated with Grimes on how to spend the money, which would be against the rules. Documents show Grimes appeared to be making arrangements with a social media company called Aggregate IQ before he officially knew how much money he would receive, causing anxiety among investigators. The case design seems suspicious because Grimes arranged services on June 13, but only received confirmation of the donation amount on June 14.

This article explains that new details have surfaced about the investigation into Vote Leave's spending during the referendum campaign.

He was able to arrange services with a social media marketing firm even before he received official confirmation of the donation amount. In simple terms, the Electoral Commission is looking into whether Vote Leave arranged its other donations in a way that might have indirectly coordinated spending, which is not allowed by election rules. Essentially, Vote Leave, Grimes, and another group called Veterans for Britain are under scrutiny. This situation raises questions about the design of the campaign’s financial operations and adds a layer of anxiety about proper spending procedures. A recent survey of internal documents revealed that the arrangement was made quickly and then confirmed later. This could affect not only the teaching for future political campaign regulations but also the overall design and total accountability in similar situations.","<<Vote Leave Investigation Explained>>

The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket – possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. “The data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,” said the study’s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. “We are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.” While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis’s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and – for men only – cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.

 Liz Brandow writes: I remember Helen John so vividly – her sense of humour and practical common sense were invaluable. When I arrived at the RAF Greenham peace camp to stay for a few days to help, shortly before Christmas in 1981, I was given a stack of Christmas cards to answer. I wasn’t sure: “Surely they want a reply from a real Greenham woman?” Helen retorted: “You’re a woman, you’re at Greenham – you’re a Greenham woman!” Yes, indeed, and millions of us all over the world had common cause with her, and women’s peace camps were established in several countries. I visited one in Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan, and spent the festive season of the following year at another camp near a USAF base in upstate New York. Helen was always an inspiration and leaves a huge gap. Georgina Smith writes: Helen John could be very funny and was lively company, whatever the situation. The political messages that we wrote on walls may have been graffiti, but we did not daub them – we wanted them to be read. Those we painted on the high court in Edinburgh in 2006 included No Star Wars, Ban Cluster Bombs and £76bn for Genocide, and I recall watching with Helen, from the police car, as the officers fetched large pieces of board from the adjacent building site to cover them. In the subsequent court case, we did not wish to pay a fine or undertake community service, and were sentenced to several weeks in prison for malicious mischief.

Liz remembers arriving at the camp near Christmas in 1981 and being immediately embraced as a ""Greenham woman"" by Helen, highlighting Helen's inclusive and encouraging nature. She emphasizes Helen's humour and common sense, portraying her as an inspiration for women globally, which led to similar peace camps being established in other countries. Liz even visited peace camps in New York, illustrating the movement's international reach. Georgina recalls Helen's lively personality and their shared commitment to political activism.

 Modern conflict archaeology, the study of 20th and 21st century conflicts, is a new and slightly uncomfortable discipline in the world of archaeology. It’s problematic in a number of ways. Firstly, very little of it involves what most people would recognise as archaeology – digging up cultural material from the ground for study. Most of the material legacies of modern conflicts remain above ground and embedded in current society, necessitating a more anthropological, interdisciplinary approach. Secondly, the time periods under study are often within living memory, and often remain highly contentious within the affected regions. This means that modern conflict archaeology can be a political minefield – as well as an actual minefield. I’m currently working in Iraq down in Basra province at the two thousand-year-old city of Charax Spasinou, founded by Alexander the Great in 324 BC. Thirty years ago, however, the site was home to thousands of Iraqi soldiers. The Iran-Iraq war was dragging towards its end, both sides exhausted by the waves of offensives which had made 1987 the war’s bloodiest year. That spring the Siege of Basra had cost the lives of at least 60,000 Iranian and 20,000 Iraqi soldiers.

Unlike traditional archaeology that involves excavating ancient artifacts, this discipline often examines materials that are still visible above ground in our present society. This requires researchers to use approaches from anthropology and other fields. The work can be challenging because many of these conflicts happened recently and are still sensitive topics in affected areas, making the research politically complicated and sometimes physically dangerous.

The author explains they are currently working at Charax Spasinou in Iraq, an ancient city founded by Alexander the Great over 2,000 years ago. However, this same location was occupied by thousands of Iraqi soldiers just thirty years earlier during the Iran-Iraq war. The text mentions that 1987 was particularly deadly, with the Siege of Basra resulting in approximately 80,000 casualties between both sides.

Newspaper articles like this one highlight how archaeological sites often contain multiple layers of history - both ancient and modern. The author is showing how one location can be significant for its ancient origins while also bearing the marks of recent warfare. This creates a unique challenge for archaeologists who must navigate both historical periods and consider the political and emotional significance of studying recent conflicts where survivors and their families still remember the events.","The text explains the field of modern conflict archaeology, which studies recent wars and conflicts. This branch of archaeology is different because it mainly focuses on events that happened during the 20th and 21st centuries. Unlike traditional archaeology that digs up artifacts from the ground, this discipline often looks at structures, landscapes, and evidence that can still be seen in our society today. Because many of these conflicts happened while people were still alive, researching them can touch on sensitive and emotional issues. The subject matter is not only about uncovering the past, but also about understanding the effects that these conflicts continue to have on people and nations.

The article also provides some background by discussing work being conducted in Iraq. The research is taking place in an ancient city, where the traces of older civilizations mix with more recent historical events. Thirty years ago, the same location was active during a significant conflict, specifically the Iran-Iraq war. The text explains that wars leave behind evidence in both old and new layers, with sites that can be dangerous to navigate, both physically and politically, due to ongoing controversies and memories of these events.

newspaper reports emphasize that modern conflict archaeology is an emerging field that blends archaeology with social science methods. Researchers work in areas that are still sensitive with memories of violence and loss, making their work challenging. They need a careful approach to interpret not only the physical remnants of battles but also the living stories and emotions connected to these events. This discipline attempts to combine a study of history, politics, and cultural changes, showing that the past is closely connected to today's world.","The field of studying recent wars and battles, called modern conflict archaeology, is fairly new and somewhat difficult for archaeologists. Usually, archaeology is about unearthing old objects from the ground. However, with recent wars, much of what's left behind is still visible and part of present-day life. This means researchers need to use methods from other fields like anthropology, which studies human societies and cultures. It can be sensitive because the events they study are often within people's memories and still cause disagreement.

Studying modern conflict zones can be tricky, not just because of political issues but also the real danger of unexploded weapons. The writer gives an example of working in Iraq, at an ancient city that was once a base for Iraqi troops during the Iran-Iraq war. This war was extremely deadly, with a major battle costing tens of thousands of lives on both sides.

Newspaper reports state that even ancient locations can hold recent memories of violence and loss. The past is not always buried deeply in the ground; sometimes, it's right there on the surface, affecting people's lives today. This type of archaeology has to consider these factors and be sensitive to the communities involved.

Section 1
This text contains the start of several different letters to the editor from The Guardian newspaper. Let me break them down:

1. The first letter is from someone who attended a dress rehearsal of an opera called ""Marnie"" at the ENO (English National Opera). They're disappointed that critic Tim Ashley gave the opera a negative headline despite writing positive things in the actual review. They fear this negative headline might discourage people from seeing this new work. The evidence suggests there's a disconnect between the headline and the actual content of the review.

2. The second letter mentions a Pakistani colleague who said politicians in Pakistan make money while in office, but UK politicians make money after leaving office. The writer thinks Kezia Dugdale (a Scottish politician) is breaking this tradition by joining a reality TV show while still an MSP (Member of Scottish Parliament), suggesting she's trying to get a financial bonus too early.

3. The third letter asks why Cornwall, described as very poor, elects Conservative MPs, suggesting this might be what Karl Marx called ""false consciousness"" (when people vote against their economic interests).

4. The final passage is about a coffee stall in Edinburgh that offered ""café au lait, with or without milk"" - which is humorous because café au lait literally means coffee with milk, so offering it ""without milk"" is contradictory.

These snippets show how newspapers like The Guardian include reader letters that cap off news coverage with personal opinions and observations.

This passage is a series of news notes. The first part describes a dress rehearsal of an opera where the audience loved the performance. However, despite the very positive comments within the review—calling it superb and praising the quality of acting, staging, and music—the headline was a bonus mislead that might cause a break in interest among readers. Essentially, the reporter argues that the negative title puts a cap on the enthusiasm the detailed positive review provided as evidence of its quality. The rest of the passage includes reader letters commenting on political differences between countries and historical quirks, such as why a poor region might still have several Conservative MPs, with one letter even comparing it to Marx’s ideas.

This passage presents several reader responses to recent events reported in The Guardian. One reader expresses disappointment with a negative review of the opera ""Marnie,"" arguing that the review's headline doesn't match the reviewer's positive observations about the performance. There seems to be an absence of clear evidence to back up the review's negativity. Another reader humorously comments on Kezia Dugdale's decision to join a reality TV show soon after leaving her political position, suggesting it's a quick bonus rather than a delayed one, which the reader suggests is the norm; a 'break' from tradition, if you will. A third reader questions why Cornwall, a poor region, elects so many Conservative MPs, implying they may be laboring under false consciousness. Finally, someone adds a detail about historical coffee preferences, referencing a previous letter about ""milky coffee."" There's no indication of a 'cap' on comments about such topics.

 Kezia Dugdale, the former leader of Scottish Labour, has jetted off to the Australian bush to join Ant and Dec and the cast of 12 in this year’s I’m a Celebrity. It would be fair to say her decision has split the entire country, and particularly Scottish Labour. Dugdale’s announcement came on the eve of the naming of the party’s new leader, Richard Leonard. The Dugdale affair overshadowed his first meeting with MSPs this afternoon where it was accepted she should not after all be suspended from the party, thereby agreeing with a call Jeremy Corbyn had already made. The political row since the news broke on Friday has followed a familiar path – a bilious piece in the Scottish Daily Mail which is now mysteriously hard to access, a well-targeted tease from Nicola Sturgeon, tweeting her support for #teamkez, and a general atmosphere of outrage over an MSP taking well-paid time out from her day job. Dugdale was reportedly told by the party not to go, but went anyway, joining a roll of parliamentarians from Nadine Dorries to Penny Mordaunt who have tried reality TV as a career accelerant, with, it is only fair to say, mixed results. Dugdale herself has not yet landed in the jungle, where the other contestants – not including many household names – are already breakfasting on bugs, weeping silently on camera etc etc. My money is on Stanley Johnson, father of Boris, who at some point will reveal that at his prep school funnel-web spiders were a delicacy and the washing facilities in the bush are a definite improvement.

Comfort is not what Kezia Dugdale, former Scottish Labour leader, will likely find in the Australian bush as she joins the reality TV show ""I'm a Celebrity."" She has decided to participate in this show where contestants face challenges like eating bugs and living in rough conditions. This decision has created division within her political party and across Scotland, especially since it happened just as a new leader, Richard Leonard, was taking over Scottish Labour.

The party initially considered suspending Dugdale for taking this paid opportunity away from her duties as a Member of Scottish Parliament (MSP), but ultimately decided against it, following the recommendation of Jeremy Corbyn (the UK Labour leader). The situation has created typical political drama, with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon playfully supporting ""team Kez"" online and many people expressing outrage that an elected official would take time off for a reality show.

Dugdale ignored her party's advice not to participate, joining other politicians who have tried reality TV to boost their public profiles - with varying levels of success. The article notes that she hasn't yet arrived at the filming location, where other contestants (who aren't very famous) are already dealing with the show's uncomfortable challenges like eating insects and emotional breakdowns on camera.

The author suggests that Dugdale must have known the risks of joining such a show, as anyone who participates in reality TV faces predictable criticism. The text concludes that there's no way to interpret Dugdale's decision except as motivated by money and a desire for tabloid attention, suggesting the move is purely self-serving rather than beneficial to her political career or constituents.

P.S. The article also humorously predicts that Stanley Johnson (father of Boris Johnson) might perform well on the show, joking that he'll probably claim the harsh conditions are actually an improvement over his elite boarding school experiences.","<<Guardian’s Take on Dugdale’s Reality TV Adventure>>

comfort: This article tells the story of Kezia Dugdale, the former leader of Scottish Labour, who has decided to join the reality TV show ""I’m a Celebrity"" in Australia. Her choice has sparked controversy, dividing opinions in Scotland and within her own party, especially since her party had advised her not to participate in the program.

The article explains that Dugdale’s decision coincides with a major political event—the announcement of a new leader for Scottish Labour. The timing has meant that her move has overshadowed other important political discussions, making it a hot topic in the press and on social media.

It points out that Dugdale’s participation in the show is seen by many as a way to grab media attention and potentially earn money, rather than serving her political career. The piece compares her to other UK politicians who have tried reality TV as a way to boost their profiles, often with mixed success.

In summary, the article from the Guardian is a mix of political commentary and media criticism, highlighting how a serious political figure has turned to a popular TV program for personal gain, sparking outrage and humor in equal measure. P.S. Feel free to ask if you need any more details or clarification on the explanation.","<<Dugdale's Jungle Jaunt: A Political Headache>>

Comfortably ensconced in controversy, former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has traded the political arena for the Australian jungle, joining the cast of ""I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!"" This decision has ignited a firestorm, dividing opinions across Scotland and within her own party. The timing couldn't be worse, coinciding with the announcement of Richard Leonard as the new Labour leader, effectively overshadowing his debut.

The fallout from Dugdale's decision has followed a predictable pattern, marked by scathing commentary in the Scottish Daily Mail, a playful jab from Nicola Sturgeon, and widespread indignation over a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) prioritizing a lucrative television appearance over her parliamentary duties. Despite being reportedly advised against it by her party, Dugdale has ventured into the world of reality TV, following in the footsteps of other politicians who have sought to boost their careers through such appearances, albeit with varying degrees of success.

The other contestants, a collection of not-so-famous faces, are already experiencing the jungle's delights, from bug breakfasts to emotional breakdowns captured on camera. One potential highlight is Stanley Johnson, Boris Johnson's father, who may reveal some eccentric habits from his past. However, Dugdale faces a significant risk by participating in the show, as her motivations are inevitably seen as a combination of financial gain and seeking tabloid attention.

Ultimately, Dugdale's decision has placed her in a difficult position, subjecting her to intense scrutiny and raising questions about her commitment to her role as an MSP. The public perception is that her actions are driven by a desire for money and fame, and the political consequences could be significant.

P.S. This situation highlights the ongoing tension between public service and personal ambition in the world of politics.

 Taylor Swift’s Reputation has become the biggest-selling album of the year in the US in a single week, with 1.23m sales. That total comfortably beats the 931,000 copies of ÷ sold by Ed Sheeran since he released it in early March. Swift has kept all but four songs from Reputation off streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, meaning that fans need to pay to download the album or buy it on CD if they want to hear it. She also, somewhat controversially, created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album increased their chances of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, thus further driving sales. Nielsen, which collates album sales data in the US, said that Reputation sold more copies than the rest of the top 200 albums put together. Swift’s previous three albums have all sold more than a million copies in the US in their first week– a feat increasingly difficult to achieve as the popularity of downloads and CDs continues to wane. Her label Big Machine reported that a further 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, 84,000 of which were in the UK, which gives it the sixth-largest first week UK sales of the year, behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag’N’Bone Man and Swift’s friend Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of ÷ in the first week of its release. Swift’s impressive US total is still some way off the all-time first week sales record set by Adele in 2015, when her album 25 sold 3.37m copies in the US in its opening week. Forbes, meanwhile, has estimated that Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, dropping from the top spot last year when her earnings were driven by tour revenues from her previous album, 1989.

Paragraph 1 must start with word mention.",simplify,"""Taylor Swift's album 'Reputation' has become incredibly successful, selling 1.23 million copies in just one week in the US, making it the best-selling album of 2017 there. This sales figure beats Ed Sheeran's album '÷' which had sold 931,000 copies since March. Swift used some strategic marketing tactics to achieve these impressive numbers. She kept most songs from the album off streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, forcing fans to buy the full album if they wanted to hear it. She also created a controversial promotion where fans who purchased multiple copies of the album improved their chances of getting concert tickets for her upcoming tour, which further boosted sales. According to Nielsen, the company that tracks album sales in the US, 'Reputation' sold more copies than all the other albums in the top 200 combined. Swift has a history of strong album performance - her previous three albums also sold more than a million copies each in their first week in the US, which is increasingly difficult to achieve as physical album sales continue to decline in popularity. Beyond the US, Swift's label reported that 'Reputation' sold an additional 905,000 copies worldwide, with 84,000 of those sales coming from the UK. Despite these impressive numbers, the album ranks as only the sixth-largest first-week sales in the UK for 2017, behind albums by artists like Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag'N'Bone Man, and Ed Sheeran, whose album '÷' sold 671,000 copies in its first week in the UK. While Swift's US sales are remarkable, they still don't reach the all-time record set by Adele in 2015, when her album '25' sold an astonishing 3.37 million copies in its first week in the US. The article also mentions that according to Forbes, Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, having earned an estimated $44 million (£33 million). This represents a drop from her position as the highest earner the previous year when her income was boosted by tour revenue from her earlier album '1989.' In 2017, Beyoncé took the top spot among female musicians with earnings of $105 million (£79 million), largely due to her Formation world tour, while Adele earned $69 million (£52 million), placing her second on the list. The article essentially highlights how Swift's album has achieved remarkable commercial success through a combination of her established popularity and strategic business decisions regarding distribution and promotion, though it also places this success in context by comparing it to other major artists' achievements.""","""mention this article explains in simpler terms that Taylor Swift’s album Reputation has broken records in the US by selling a huge number of copies in just one week – 1.23 million in total – which is more than any other album has achieved so far this year in America. This success is even more impressive when compared to Ed Sheeran’s album ÷, which sold 931,000 copies since its release in early March. One reason for Reputation’s remarkable sales is that Taylor Swift made a deliberate choice to keep almost all of the songs on the album off popular streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. Because of this, fans who want to listen to her new music must either buy the album to download it or purchase a physical CD. In addition to this strategy, Taylor Swift ran a special and somewhat controversial promotion: fans who bought multiple copies of the album got better chances to win tickets to her upcoming tour. This tactic not only encouraged her fans to buy more copies than usual but also helped drive overall sales higher. According to Nielsen, the company that gathers music sales data in the US, Reputation managed to sell more copies than the combined total of the other top 200 albums for that week, which shows just how big of a phenomenon it has become. The article also points out that Taylor Swift’s previous three albums all managed to sell over a million copies in their first week. This is a notable achievement, especially at a time when fewer people are buying music as downloads or physical CDs because streaming has become so popular. Beyond the US, Taylor Swift’s album also did well globally. Her record label, Big Machine, reported an additional 905,000 album copies sold worldwide, including 84,000 in the UK. In the United Kingdom, this makes Reputation the album with the sixth-highest first week sales of the year. Some other well-known artists like Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag’N’Bone Man, and Ed Sheeran (with his album ÷ which sold 671,000 copies in its first week) have also been very successful, but Taylor Swift remains a top contender. However, it’s important to note that despite these impressive numbers, Taylor Swift’s first week in the US still falls short of the all-time record set by Adele in 2015 when her album 25 sold 3.37 million copies in its opening week. Forbes also weighed in by estimating that Taylor Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017. This represents a drop from her previous status as the top earner, a change attributed in part to lower tour revenues than those she generated for her earlier album, 1989. For context, she was estimated to have earned about $44 million (or £33 million) that year, which is lower than the earnings of Beyoncé and Adele, who made $105 million (or £79 million) and $69 million (or £52 million), respectively. Overall, the article shows that Taylor Swift’s Reputation is a commercial powerhouse. It not only outperforms many other albums in its first week but also uses innovative sales strategies like limiting streaming access and offering special promotions to boost sales. This success reinforces her status as one of the leading figures in the music industry today, showing that even in an era dominated by streaming, she can motivate her fans to purchase her music in large numbers and invest in her brand.""","""Mentioning Taylor Swift's album ""Reputation,"" the news article highlights its remarkable commercial success, particularly in the United States. It achieved the highest first-week sales of any album in the US for the year, selling a staggering 1.23 million copies. This easily surpassed Ed Sheeran's ""÷"" (Divide), which had sold 931,000 copies since its release earlier in March. The article emphasizes that Swift strategically limited the availability of her album on streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, effectively requiring fans to purchase the album either through downloads or physical CDs to access most of the songs. This tactic undeniably contributed to the impressive sales figures. Furthermore, the article points out a somewhat controversial promotional strategy employed by Swift's team. This involved incentivizing fans to purchase multiple copies of the album by offering increased chances of securing tickets to her upcoming tour. While effective in boosting sales, this approach sparked debate regarding its fairness and potential manipulation of the market. According to Nielsen, the company that tracks album sales data in the US, ""Reputation"" outsold the combined sales of the next 200 top-selling albums, demonstrating its immense popularity and market dominance. The article also notes that Swift has a consistent track record of achieving significant first-week sales. Her previous three albums had all surpassed the million-copy mark in their debut week in the US, a feat that is becoming increasingly challenging to achieve due to the growing popularity of streaming services and the decline of physical album sales. In addition to the impressive US sales, Swift's label, Big Machine, reported that another 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, with 84,000 of those sales occurring in the United Kingdom. This made ""Reputation"" the sixth-highest-selling album in the UK during its first week, trailing behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag'N'Bone Man, and even her friend Ed Sheeran, whose ""÷"" sold 671,000 copies in its first week. However, despite the impressive sales figures, the article clarifies that Swift's US sales total still falls short of the all-time first-week sales record, which is held by Adele. In 2015, Adele's album ""25"" sold an astounding 3.37 million copies in the US during its opening week. Shifting focus to Swift's overall earnings, the article cites Forbes' estimation that she ranked as the third-highest-earning female musician in 2017. This represents a drop from the top spot she held in the previous year, when her earnings were primarily driven by tour revenues from her previous album, ""1989."" In 2017, Swift's estimated earnings were $44 million (£33 million), placing her behind Beyoncé, whose Formation world tour generated earnings of $105 million (£79 million), and Adele, who earned $69 million (£52 million). In summary, the article paints a picture of Taylor Swift's ""Reputation"" as a commercially successful album that employed strategic release tactics to maximize sales. While it achieved remarkable first-week sales figures, it fell short of breaking the all-time record. Additionally, the article provides context by comparing Swift's earnings to those of other top female musicians and highlights the challenges of achieving significant album sales in the age of streaming.""

 Mervyn Johnston sips his tea while sizing up the pristine-looking 1967 Mini Cooper that has come in for repairs from across the border. As the UK’s historic decision to quit the EU plays out, it doesn’t take much for the softly spoken 78-year-old and five-times rally-driving champion to cast his mind back to the days when customs posts and army checkpoints brought life in the picturesque village of Pettigo to a halt. “We had about half a dozen incendiary bombs before the big one,” he says, tilting his chin to the other classic-cars garage across the road, now run by his son. “That blew the garage right into the river.” Pettigo is unique in Ireland as it is the only village divided by the border after Ireland gained independence from Britain in 1922. The river that runs beneath his workshop window places Johnston’s Protestant family in Northern Ireland and his largely Catholic neighbours on the other side of the 1820s cut-stone bridge in the republic of Ireland. This village has seen more than its fair share of pain. Just to be associated with Britain during the Troubles of the late 60s to 90s was to be a target. “One day, a couple of IRA men came to the garage. I was held at gunpoint. They walked me up the road and held me at the customs post,” he says, pointing to the stone wall outside his garage.

He thinks about the past while working on an old Mini Cooper. He recalls when the border had checkpoints that disrupted village life. His garage was bombed during the conflict, with the worst explosion destroying part of it.

***

Pettigo is special because it's the only village that was divided when Ireland became independent from Britain in 1922. A river marks the border - Johnston's family, who are Protestant, live on the Northern Ireland side, while many Catholic residents live on the Republic side. The physical division is just a small bridge from the 1820s.

***

The village experienced significant violence during ""the Troubles"" (the conflict from the late 1960s to 1990s). Johnston describes a frightening incident when members of the IRA (Irish Republican Army) held him at gunpoint and forced him to walk to the customs post. Simply being associated with Britain during this time made people targets for violence.","Mervyn Johnston is an elderly car enthusiast and mechanic who works on a classic car. While he repairs a well-maintained vehicle from another country, he recalls a time when border checkpoints and inspections would halt everyday life. Memories of incidents from long ago, including an explosion that damaged a workshop, come back to him as he contemplates those challenging days.

The village where he works, Pettigo, is special because it lies on both sides of a border. One side belongs to one community while the other side is linked to a different community. His own family has deep roots on one side, while many of his neighbors come from the other, which has often meant living with tension and distrust.

He also shares a personal recollection of a frightening encounter during a period of regional conflict. In the past, armed individuals from a rebel group once forced him along a path and stopped at a checkpoint, reminding him of the dangerous and divided times in the area. These memories highlight how the enduring impact of historical conflicts still touches the lives of people in this border village.","Mervyn Johnston, an elderly rally driver, is observing a vintage Mini Cooper being repaired. The UK's exit from the EU makes him think back to when the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was much more heavily controlled. This significantly impacted life in Pettigo, a village split by the border.

Johnston recalls violence during ""the Troubles,"" a period of conflict. His garage was bombed, and he recounts being held at gunpoint by the IRA simply for being associated with Britain. Pettigo is special because it is the only village to be divided by the border after Irish independence.

 Visitors to Hidden House, in London’s Clerkenwell, often need a little help to find it. It’s virtually invisible from three sides because it nestles into the angles of an old boundary wall that runs between back gardens and an imposing Victorian school. As owner Selim Bayer explains: “You’re walking around the wall and suddenly there’s a door. People are always amazed and ask, ‘Oh! Are we here?’” It’s not just an obscure spot, but also an unpromising one. The house is built on the site of a caretaker’s shed and the scrap of wasteland behind it. Because it is bounded on three sides by a Grade II listed wall, only the fourth side has windows. So it’s a revelation to come inside and be struck by the sense of space and light in here. It is proof positive of the power of good architecture and has justly earned a place on the Riba House of the Year long-list, currently being explored in a special Grand Designs television series.

 Apple has been accused of relying on students working illegal overtime to build the iPhone X, through its contractor Foxconn, which manufactures the devices in Zhengzhou, China. According to the Financial Times, students working at the Foxconn plant, as part of a three month “work experience” placement, were routinely working 11-hour days assembling the newest phone, breaking Chinese overtime laws in the process. Student labour is common, and legal, in manufacturing hubs in China. The students must be paid, and the placements must be voluntary, with the number of temporary workers swelling employment at the Zhengzhou factory threefold in the busiest time of the year, the paper reported. But, according to the Financial Times, such work experience should be limited to just 40 hours a week. Six high school students, out of a group of 3,000 from one vocational school sent to work at the factory, told the paper that those legal limits were exceeded. In a statement, Apple said: “During the course of a recent audit, we discovered instances of student interns working overtime at a supplier facility in China. We’ve confirmed the students worked voluntarily, were compensated and provided benefits, but they should not have been allowed to work overtime.” “At this facility, student intern programs are short term and account for a very small percentage of the workforce. When we found that some students were allowed to work overtime, we took prompt action. A team of specialists are on site at the facility working with the management on systems to ensure the appropriate standards are adhered to.” “Apple is dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.

First response:
This news article reports that Apple is in trouble because students in China were working too many hours making iPhone X devices. A company called Foxconn, which builds Apple products in China, had high school students working 11-hour days as part of ""work experience"" programs. While student workers are legal in China, they're not supposed to work more than 40 hours per week. Apple admitted finding this problem during an inspection and said the students volunteered and were paid, but acknowledged they shouldn't have been working overtime. Apple claims they're taking action to fix the situation and ensure workers are treated properly.

Second response:
The Guardian reported that Apple's contractor Foxconn had Chinese students working illegal overtime to make iPhone X phones. The students were doing ""work experience"" at Foxconn's factory in China but were working 11-hour days, which breaks Chinese labor laws that limit student work to 40 hours weekly. While hiring students is legal in China if they're paid and volunteer, six students told reporters they were working more hours than allowed. When caught, Apple acknowledged the problem, saying they found students working overtime during an audit. Apple stated they're sending specialists to fix the issue and emphasized their commitment to treating workers in their supply chain with dignity.","Here's one simplified explanation:

These students, who were part of a work experience program, ended up working 11-hour days—more than what's allowed under Chinese law—even though their work was supposed to be limited to 40 hours per week. Although the practice of using student workers is legal in China when they are paid and the work is voluntary, Apple admits there were cases where students did overtime. The company says it has taken steps to fix the issue by sending inspectors to the factory to make sure rules are followed in the future.

******
And here's another way to explain it:

The article reports that at an Apple contractor’s factory in China, six high school students were found working longer hours than legally permitted. These students were doing a temporary work placement meant to provide a learning experience, but they ended up working 11 hours a day instead of only 40 hours per week. Apple confirmed the students were paid and volunteered, but admitted that they should not have been allowed to work extra hours. As a result, Apple has taken action by sending experts to the site to ensure that all work rules and standards are properly followed.","Apple is being criticized for using student labor at a factory in China (owned by Foxconn) to make iPhones. These students, who were there as part of a work experience program, were allegedly forced to work longer hours than Chinese law allows. Apple admits that some students worked overtime but claims they did so willingly and were paid, but also says that they shouldn't have been allowed to work overtime. Apple is now investigating to prevent this from happening again and emphasizing their commitment to fair treatment in their supply chain.

******

Basically, Apple is in trouble because a factory that makes iPhones in China is accused of making students work illegal overtime. These students were there to gain work experience. Apple admits it happened and says it's taking steps to fix the problem and ensure workers are treated fairly.

 The films of American artists Mary Reid Kelley and Patrick Kelley are, to use a technical term, bonkers. Actors and sets are rendered as though they inhabit a slapdash monochrome painting, rejigged as a silent-era black-and-white movie. The actors wear cartoonish theatrical makeup, which extends to cover their clothes and all the objects and furnishings that surround them. This, in itself, is arresting and strange. Somewhere between the avant garde and the amateur, between theatre and cartoon, history lesson and literature class, their films are equally curious in their subject matter. For their first UK exhibition in a public gallery, Mary and Patrick (the pair prefer to use their first names) are showing two films and a number of lightbox photographs. In one film, This Is Offal, we find ourselves witnessing the autopsy of a drowned woman. In the second, In The Body of the Sturgeon, we are on board a US submarine, somewhere in the Pacific, in the closing days of the second world war. It’s hot in there, dank and claustrophobic.

 It is a £700m cathedral to biomedical science, where scientists work together to make breakthroughs in cancer, neuroscience, pandemics and genetics. But the Francis Crick Institute is not proving to be the easiest place to concentrate. A year after opening, some of the 1,250 people working at the Crick Institute, in its central London laboratory, have complained that the open plan design, intended to assist informal collaboration, means some areas set aside for thinking and writing up research are too noisy. Chattering members of the public and colleagues celebrating PhD awards have been cited by those who, anecdotal evidence suggests, have been struggling to adapt to working alongside the building’s cavernous atrium. “There are individuals that complain,” said Nicholas Luscombe, leader of one of the Crick’s research groups. “Some people like the background noise as if they were working in a cafe. Some want absolute silence and it’s not great for that. My view is the layout has been extremely successful in terms of what it set out to achieve. You keep bumping into people and that has created new collaborations for me.” The Crick is carrying out tests on noise levels and examining whether the acoustics need to be improved, a spokeswoman said. Dr Kerstin Sailer, reader in social and spatial networks at University College London’s Bartlett School of Architecture, who is researching the way the building is performing, said “some people say it is very loud, specifically those spaces close to the atrium”.

 MPs have accused the government of failing to protect consumers over the price it has promised to pay for power from the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. The Commons public accounts committee said the subsidy contract for Hinkley Point C, agreed in 2016 after years of delays, would hit poorest households hardest. The power station is expected to cost billpayers £30bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding £10-£15 to the average household energy bill. But an assessment by the committee concluded that no one in Whitehall was championing consumers’ interests during negotiations with French company EDF Energy. The final bill for consumers was exacerbated by government not renegotiating the guaranteed power price for fear that EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would walk away from the project, which the MPs said was a questionable assumption. Officials agreed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 but fossil fuel price projections fell between then and the contract being signed in 2016, pushing the cost to consumers up fivefold from £6bn to £30bn. At the time the Department of Energy and Climate Change – now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy – did not consider a ceiling on the guaranteed price, the MPs were told. Meg Hillier, chair of the group of MPs, said: “Billpayers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project.” The criticism from the committee follows a damning report by the UK’s spending watchdog, the NAO, which found the contract for Hinkley had locked consumers into a “risky and expensive project”. The NAO attacked the government for failing to explore alternative financing models, such as taking stake in the project, a criticism that the MPs echoed. The public accounts committee said it was also disappointed that the government appeared to have no plan in place to maximise the wider benefits of the project, beyond the clean power it will provide.

State representatives in Parliament are criticizing the government for not protecting consumers regarding the price agreed for power from the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. The Commons public accounts committee believes the 2016 subsidy contract will particularly hurt poorer households by adding £10-£15 to average energy bills, costing billpayers £30 billion over 35 years. They found that no government official was looking out for consumers during negotiations with EDF Energy. The situation worsened when officials didn't renegotiate the power price despite changing market conditions, fearing the French and Chinese partners would abandon the project.

The committee chairperson, Meg Hillier, stated that consumers received ""a bad hand"" from the government's approach. This criticism follows a report by the spending watchdog (NAO) that called the project ""risky and expensive."" Both the NAO and the committee criticized the government for not exploring other financing options, such as taking a stake in the project themselves. Additionally, the committee expressed disappointment that the government apparently has no plan to maximize wider benefits from the project beyond the clean power it will generate.","<<Hinkley Point C Contract Criticism>>

state the MPs are saying that the government made a poor deal when agreeing on the cost to buy power from the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. They argue the contract, set up in 2016, will force households—especially those with lower incomes—to pay more for energy over a 35-year period. The agreed price turned out to be much higher than expected because, even though the price was set before fossil fuel costs dropped, the contract did not include a limit to stop prices from going too high. This decision means consumers may end up paying a lot more, with projections rising the total bill from £6bn to around £30bn.

The committee members and a watchdog report from the National Audit Office both criticize the government for not doing enough to protect the public. They believe that by not renegotiating the contract or exploring other financing options—like taking an ownership stake—the government left consumers exposed to a risky deal. In essence, the arguments suggest that the government's approach did not look out for the best interests of the public, leaving people to bear unnecessary costs.","<<Hinkley Point C Controversy>>

State officials are under fire for a deal concerning the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, with accusations of failing to protect consumers from high electricity prices. A parliamentary committee suggests that the agreed-upon contract, which promises a certain price for the plant's power, will disproportionately burden low-income families. Over the 35-year contract, households may pay an extra £10-£15 annually, totaling £30 billion, because the government didn't strongly advocate for consumer interests when negotiating with EDF Energy, the French company behind the project.

The government's reluctance to renegotiate the guaranteed power price, fearing EDF and its Chinese partner CGN might abandon the project, led to increased costs for consumers. The price was set at £92.50 per megawatt hour in 2013, but with falling fossil fuel prices, the cost to consumers significantly increased by the time the contract was signed in 2016. Critics argue the government didn't explore other financing options or a price ceiling, and lacked a plan to maximize benefits beyond clean power. A spending watchdog also criticized the deal as ""risky and expensive"".

The rules but have been heavily criticized by internet service providers and Pai. “The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and pre-emptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai told Reuters. He added that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet. “We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses.” The move is likely to spark a furious battle before the FCC’s vote on the proposals on 14 December. About 21m comments were submitted to the regulator as it discussed the proposals, and activists have flooded legislators with more than 250,000 calls condemning Pai’s plans.

He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his “inexplicable failure”. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui’s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui’s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a “driven young man” aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. “Whilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui’s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,” Mallalieu said.

A 39-year-old Oxford graduate named Faiz Siddiqui is suing Oxford University for £1 million. He claims that poor teaching during his history course 17 years ago resulted in him getting a lower grade than expected. Siddiqui believes he received inadequate instruction because many professors were on sabbatical leave and the university didn't find replacements. He also alleges that a tutor failed to submit his medical information to examiners. Siddiqui argues that if he had received better grades (a first or high 2:1 instead of a low 2:1), he would have become a successful international commercial lawyer. He claims his ""inexplicable failure"" has worsened his depression and insomnia.

SECTION 2
This legal battle has been ongoing for over a year. Last year, a judge allowed the case to proceed to trial despite Oxford's claims that it had no merit and was filed too late. Now the case is being heard in the High Court in London. Siddiqui's lawyer described him as a ""driven young man"" who had planned to attend an Ivy League university for postgraduate studies before pursuing a career at a major law firm. While most people would consider a 2:1 degree from Oxford an impressive achievement, it was a major disappointment for Siddiqui because it fell short of his expectations and career ambitions.

P.P.S. This case raises interesting questions about university accountability, the impact of education quality on career prospects, and the reasonable timeframe for legal claims related to educational outcomes.","SECTION 1  
An Oxford graduate is suing the university for £1 million because he believes poor teaching led to a lower degree than he deserved. He claims that having key professors absent and a tutor's mistake in handling his medical information caused him to receive a 2:1 instead of the top marks he needed. He argues this lower grade cost him the chance to pursue a lucrative legal career.

SECTION 2  
The case has been in progress for over a year after a judge decided it could continue despite Oxford's claims that it was too old to bring and lacked merit. His barrister noted that in 2000, he was an ambitious student aiming for further study at an elite American university and a high-profile career at prestigious law firms. Although a 2:1 degree is normally a good achievement, he feels it fell far short of his expectations and worsened his mental health issues.

Ali Martin: Australia to pilfer the urn, with home conditions proving the difference between what are two imperfect teams with near identical win-loss records since the last time they met. Andy Bull: Australia. Their fast bowlers are just that much more dangerous in these conditions and England’s batsmen haven’t kicked their bad habit of collapsing in a heap.

 The New England Patriots got the result they wanted on their trip to Mexico City on Sunday, beating the Oakland Raiders 33-8. Their coach, however, is in no rush to repeat the experience. “Players did a great job dealing with all the challenges we had to deal with. I think we’re fortunate there was no volcano eruptions or earthquakes, or anything else while we were down there,” Bill Belichick said in an appearance on WEEI on Monday. “You have two NFL franchises in an area that I don’t know how stable the geological plates that were below us [were], but nothing happened, so that was good.” Belichick’s fears are odd considering he has never voiced concerns about traveling to play any of the NFL teams in California along the San Andreas Fault, an area prone to earthquakes. The Patriots have also played in Seattle twice in the past 10 years; the city sits close to the volcanic Mount Rainier and it is believed an eruption could affect the city. Belichick did, however, cite other concerns about the Mexico City trip. “It’s a long way to go for a game,” Belichick said. “There’s a lot to it in terms of all the logistics of it.

This text is essentially a collection of brief descriptions of TV shows that were scheduled to air on British television. The format follows what you'd typically find in a TV guide or newspaper listing section. Let me explain each program in simpler terms:

## Blue Planet II (8pm, BBC One)
This is a nature documentary about ocean life. This particular episode focuses on underwater plant environments like kelp forests and seagrass meadows. The show features stunning high-definition footage of sea creatures, including some unusual ones like a ten-armed sea cucumber eating starfish eggs (which the writer compares to a monster from Star Wars), a type of fish called the Garibaldi damselfish protecting its territory from sea urchins, and a cuttlefish with an interesting mating strategy. The writer, Graeme Virtue, seems impressed by the visual quality and interesting content.

## Howards End (9pm, BBC One)
This is a drama series, likely based on the classic E.M. Forster novel. In this episode, a character named Margaret (played by actress Hayley Atwell) receives a marriage proposal from a man named Henry (played by Matthew Macfadyen). Just as they're planning their wedding, someone from their past appears and causes problems for their relationship. There's also a subplot involving a character named Leonard Bast who is struggling with poverty after taking some advice from the Schlegel family. The writer, Hannah Verdier, highlights Atwell's performance as particularly good.

## Expedition Volcano (9pm, BBC Two)
This is a documentary where three presenters (Chris Jackson, Xand Van Tulleken, and Aldo Kane) travel to Congo in Africa to study an active volcano called Mount Nyiragongo. They join scientists who are conducting research on the volcano despite the obvious dangers, such as potential eruptions and harmful gases. The writer, Mark Gibbings-Jones, notes that this scientific expedition is far more exciting and dangerous than typical school science experiments.

## Guy Martin vs the Robot Car (9pm, Channel 4)
This show features Guy Martin (likely a professional driver or TV personality) testing himself against a self-driving race car called the Roboracer. The description suggests that autonomous vehicles represent a major change in the automotive industry that could threaten traditional drivers like Martin. The program appears to be setting up a man-versus-machine competition to see if human drivers still have advantages over self-driving technology.

The overall text is written in a concise, somewhat witty style typical of British TV listings, with each writer adding their own brief commentary on the shows. The descriptions aim to give readers enough information to decide if they want to watch these programs, highlighting the most interesting or unusual aspects of each show. The listing covers a mix of nature documentaries, period dramas, and technology-focused programs, suggesting a variety of educational and entertainment options available to British viewers on these channels.","This text is a preview of several TV shows that are airing on different channels, and it uses a lively and somewhat humorous tone to catch the reader’s attention. Each segment gives a short description of a particular program, along with its broadcast time, channel, and a brief look at what viewers can expect.

The first program mentioned is Blue Planet II. It is scheduled for 8pm on BBC One. The text tells us that the show offers beautiful high-definition views of underwater life. It mentions that this week’s episode focuses on life among underwater plants like kelp, algae, and seagrass. The description highlights two contrasting scenes: one is more disturbing, showing unusual and somewhat grotesque behavior in sea creatures—for instance, a sea cucumber with 10 arms is shown in a way that is compared to a scene from the movie “Return of the Jedi” (specifically linking it to the Sarlacc pit, which is known for being quite terrifying). The other scene is calm and pleasant, featuring everyday activities of sea creatures such as a Garibaldi damselfish, which is busy fending off unruly urchins, and a playful cuttlefish that employs an unexpected mating trick described as a “bold cuckolding strategy.” Essentially, the program mixes moments of striking, unusual marine behavior with more gentle and engaging underwater stories, all set against the backdrop of vivid, clear visuals of life beneath the waves.

Next up is the preview for the drama Howards End, which airs at 9pm on BBC One. This storyline revolves around the character Margaret, played by Hayley Atwell. In this episode, she receives an irresistible offer when a character named Henry (played by Matthew Macfadyen) proposes to her. The text hints that the couple's plans are quickly disrupted when someone from Margaret’s past reappears, casting doubt on their prospects. It explains that Henry reacts in his typical awkward manner to this unexpected twist, and as a result, various families in the story are brought together in complex ways. Additionally, one of the other characters, Leonard Bast, finds himself in trouble after being advised by the Schlegel family to switch jobs; as a result, he ends up facing financial hardships like poverty and hunger. This summary gives an idea that the drama contains elements of romance, unexpected challenges, and an emphasis on the messy, complicated interactions between families.

The third show is Expedition Volcano, scheduled for 9pm on BBC Two. This program follows a team of scientists led by Chris Jackson, Xand Van Tulleken, and Aldo Kane, who take an adventurous trip to the Congo. Their focus is Mount Nyiragongo, which is one of the most dramatic and active volcanoes on Earth. The description underlines that this isn’t your typical laboratory science session; instead, the scientists are working in a dangerous environment where natural events, like volcano eruptions, could pose serious risks such as lava approaching their campsite. They conduct various tests to assess the potential dangers of living so close to a perilous volcano. The narrative ends on a light-hearted note by calling it “one hell of a field trip,” suggesting that it is both exciting and a bit risky.

The final segment of the text is about Guy Martin vs the Robot Car, airing at 9pm on Channel 4. Here, the focus is on Guy Martin, who is known for his passion for motor vehicles. In this episode, he faces a major challenge: racing against an advanced automated racing car, known as the prototype Roboracer. This contest represents a clash between a human driver and cutting-edge robotic technology, highlighting the dramatic changes happening in the field of automotive engineering.

Overall, the text is a collection of engaging TV show previews that mix adventure, drama, science, and competition. Each description gives a quick glimpse into the content of the shows, using vivid imagery and creative language to evoke interest and excitement in prospective viewers.","Okay, here's a breakdown of those Guardian blurbs, simplified and expanded upon:

This excerpt is a set of mini-reviews or previews for various television programs airing that evening. Each paragraph summarizes the premise and highlights some appealing aspects of the show. Let's go through them one by one:

**1. Blue Planet II (BBC One, 8pm):**

Essentially, this is a nature documentary episode focusing on marine life within underwater forests of kelp, algae, and seagrass. It's part of the visually stunning ""Blue Planet II"" series, known for its high-definition footage of the ocean.

The reviewer highlights the diverse content of the episode. On one hand, it promises some unsettling imagery. The ""10-armed sea cucumber"" devouring starfish eggs is described in rather graphic terms, comparing it to the Sarlacc pit from ""Return of the Jedi,"" a creature known for slowly digesting its victims. This suggests viewers should expect some potentially disturbing scenes of marine creatures and their feeding habits.

On the other hand, the episode also offers more calming and engaging content. The mention of a ""diligent Garibaldi damselfish"" dealing with urchins implies we'll see interesting interactions between species and perhaps even examples of animal behavior that seem almost human-like in their purposefulness. The ""frisky cuttlefish with a bold cuckolding strategy"" further suggests intriguing and complex animal behaviors are on display, focusing this time on mating and competition.

In summary, this ""Blue Planet II"" episode promises a visually impressive and fascinating look at life in underwater forests, with a balance of both potentially unsettling and captivating scenes from the natural world.

**2. Howards End (BBC One, 9pm):**

This is a review/preview of an episode of ""Howards End,"" a drama series likely adapted from the classic novel by E.M. Forster. The focus is on the character of Margaret, played by Hayley Atwell, and her evolving relationship with Henry, portrayed by Matthew Macfadyen.

The key event in this episode seems to be Henry's proposal to Margaret, which she accepts. However, their plans for a happy future together are quickly threatened by the arrival of someone from Henry's past. The reviewer suggests that Henry reacts to this situation in a typically awkward manner, indicating some potential conflict or discomfort stemming from his character.

Furthermore, the situation will draw the families involved closer together, suggesting the drama will involve more than just Margaret and Henry's relationship, but also family dynamics and their interactions.

The review also hints at a difficult turn of events for Leonard Bast, a character who was previously advised by the Schlegel family to find a new job. Now, he is struggling with poverty and hunger, indicating that their advice may have had unintended consequences and that he is facing significant hardships.

In short, this episode of ""Howards End"" revolves around a marriage proposal, the reappearance of a figure from the past, and the ensuing drama that impacts both the central couple and the wider families, while also highlighting the unfortunate circumstances of Leonard Bast.

**3. Expedition Volcano (BBC Two, 9pm):**

This documentary program follows a team of scientists as they conduct research on Mount Nyiragongo, an active volcano located in Congo. The reviewer emphasizes that scientific work can be exciting and adventurous, going beyond stereotypical lab settings.

The description highlights the inherent dangers and challenges of studying an active volcano. The risk of being near lava is explicitly mentioned, suggesting the potential for dramatic and visually striking scenes. Furthermore, the scientists are also monitoring the risks of sickness and suffocation due to living near the volcano, emphasizing the serious health hazards involved in their research.

The reviewer concludes by calling it ""one hell of a field trip,"" reinforcing the idea that this is an extraordinary and challenging undertaking.

Essentially, ""Expedition Volcano"" offers viewers a glimpse into the adventurous and risky world of volcanology, showcasing the dedication and bravery of scientists studying one of Earth's most spectacular and dangerous natural phenomena.

**4. Guy Martin vs the Robot Car (Channel 4, 9pm):**

 Saying the NHS was already in crisis, as I – and a few other Jeremiahs – did two years ago, meant going out on a limb. Today, hardly anyone says anything else, not least because virtually all our dire predictions have become realities. Even public officials responsible for running and inspecting the NHS, who couldn’t be seen for dust then (the heads of NHS England, NHS Improvement and the Care Quality Commission), are going public on the gravity of the situation and begging the chancellor to do something in this week’s budget. Indeed, how could anyone say things are OK when, in response to an increase in the past seven years of at most 15% in A&amp;E attendances and admissions, waits in A&amp;E have gone up by 350% and waits for admission by 550%? Increasing waiting times are the canary in the mine. However, the Department of Health, whenever challenged with a another example of increasingly poor performance, excessive waits or other pressures, retorts not that this is incorrect but (without irony) that other things in the NHS are fine. In reality, all is not well. Once again, I am afraid, those who have just started to complain are saying too little and too late. The NHS isn’t getting into crisis, as they cautiously say. It is way beyond that and already failing, despite its internationally accepted efficiency.

This article discusses how the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK is in serious trouble. The author explains that they warned about this crisis two years ago, but few people listened then. Now everyone acknowledges the problem because the situation has become so bad. Even the officials who run the NHS are publicly asking for help from the government. The statistics show the problem clearly: while hospital visits increased by about 15% over seven years, waiting times have skyrocketed by 350-550%.

The author criticizes the Department of Health for downplaying the situation by claiming that other aspects of the NHS are functioning well. In reality, the entire system is struggling. The author believes that those who are only now speaking up about the problems are too hesitant in their warnings and have waited too long to act. The NHS isn't approaching a crisis - it's already failing badly, despite being known internationally for its efficiency.

Mark my words, the situation is worse than what many officials are willing to admit publicly. The increasing waiting times are just one indicator of the deeper systemic problems facing the healthcare system. The author is frustrated that their early warnings were dismissed, and now that the crisis is obvious, the response still seems inadequate to address the severity of the situation the NHS faces.

Any other questions?","<<Simpler Explanation>>
The article explains that warnings about the failing state of the NHS are now being taken seriously by the government and the public. Two years ago, a few people predicted that the NHS would be in trouble, but back then, very few believed them. Now, even those responsible for managing and inspecting the health service are publicly asking the chancellor for help because the problems have become undeniable. They point out that even though some parts of the NHS seem to be doing okay, one crucial area—the time patients spend waiting in A&E—is getting much worse and shows a trend of severe decline.

mark This text essentially argues that the problems in the NHS are far more serious than some officials are willing to admit and that the situation has progressed from worrying signs to a full-blown crisis. The increasing waiting times in the emergency departments are a clear indication that the system is under extreme pressure and in urgent need of intervention. Any other questions?","<<NHS Crisis: A Dire Warning>>

The author points out that they, along with a few others, warned two years ago that the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK was already in crisis. At that time, this view was considered extreme. However, now, almost everyone acknowledges the NHS is in trouble, as the author's earlier pessimistic predictions have unfortunately come true. Even officials responsible for managing and overseeing the NHS are now publicly expressing serious concerns and urging the government to take action.

The article emphasizes the severity of the situation by highlighting the disparity between the relatively small increase in A&E visits (15%) compared to the massive surge in waiting times (350% in A&E and 550% for admission). The author sees these longer waiting times as a clear indicator of a deeper problem within the NHS. However, the Department of Health, when confronted with these issues, often deflects by pointing out other areas where the NHS is performing well, failing to acknowledge the extent of the crisis.

Markedly, the author believes that the current concerns being voiced are insufficient and overdue. The NHS is not merely approaching a crisis, but is already failing despite its reputation for efficiency. The author asserts that the situation is far more critical than many are willing to admit.

 Ten of the 12 water companies in the UK have admitted they are still using the practice of water dowsing despite the lack of scientific evidence for its effectiveness. The disclosure has prompted calls for the regulator to stop companies passing the cost of a discredited medieval practice on to their customers. Ofwat said any firm failing to meet its commitments to customers faced a financial penalty. Dowsers, or water witchers, claim that their divining rods cross over when the presence of water is detected below ground. It is regarded as a pseudoscience, after numerous studies showed it was no better than chance at finding water. Some water companies, however, insisted the practice could be as effective as modern methods. The discovery that firms were still using water diviners was made by the science blogger Sally Le Page, after her parents reported seeing an engineer from Severn Trent “walking around holding two bent tent pegs to locate a pipe” near their home in Stratford-upon-Avon. Le Page asked Severn Trent why it was still using divining rods to find pipes when there was no evidence that it worked. Replying on Twitter, the company said: “We’ve found that some of the older methods are just as effective than the new ones, but we do use drones as well, and now satellites.” Le Page then asked the other 11 water companies whether they were using water dowsing. Only one, Wessex Water, said it did not use divining rods, and one, Northern Ireland Water had yet to reply.

Basically, most water companies in the UK (10 out of 12) are still using a method called ""water dowsing"" to find water or pipes underground. Water dowsing is an old practice where people use tools like rods or sticks that are supposed to move when they're near water underground.

The problem is that science says water dowsing doesn't actually work any better than just guessing. Despite this, some water companies claim it's as good as modern technology.

This came to light when a science blogger's parents saw a Severn Trent engineer using dowsing rods. The blogger questioned the company, and they said they found it effective. Then, the blogger contacted all the other water companies, and most admitted they still use dowsing.

Because it is not based in science, people are asking the regulator (Ofwat) to stop the water companies from charging customers for using this unproven method. Ofwat has said it will penalize companies that don't fulfill their obligations to customers.

P.S. It's surprising that companies are still using a method that's considered a pseudoscience!

 In normal times, the first budget after a general election is a predictable affair. The chancellor of the exchequer stands up, conjures up the ghost of Sir Stafford Cripps, administers some pain and quickly moves on. In Westminster it is known as aligning the economic and political cycles. In plain English, it means getting the bad news out of the way early in order that there will be money to spare just before voters have to go to the polls again. Only rarely do governments deviate from this approach and when they do it rarely ends well. But these are not normal times. It is simply not possible for Philip Hammond to raise taxes in the hope that, given time, the public will have forgotten all about it. This is a minority government that might not go the distance and, rather like Denis Healey in 1974, Hammond has to prepare for the possibility that there will be another election before too long. What’s more, the reason it might not survive until the scheduled end of the parliament in 2022 is that a good chunk of the public decided in June this year that it wanted more houses built, more money spent on the NHS, less-crowded trains and better roads – the things Jeremy Corbyn said they could have if the government was prepared to borrow to invest and to tax the rich more heavily. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, thinks the tide turned against austerity during the course of 2016, partly because the public wearied of cuts and partly because Labour articulated an alternative.

  ""explanation"": ""This text is talking about how government budgets usually work after an election, and how the current situation is different.\n\nNormally, a new finance minister (chancellor) delivers a tough budget with bad news early in their term, so that by the next election they can offer tax cuts or spending increases when voters will remember them more.\n\nBut the current situation in the UK is unusual because:\n\n1. The government doesn't have a majority in Parliament\n2. They might face another election soon\n3. In the recent election, many people voted for the opposition (Labour) because they promised more public spending on things like healthcare, housing, and transportation\n\nThe text suggests that Finance Minister Philip Hammond can't follow the usual pattern of delivering bad news now because the government is too weak politically, and public opinion seems to be turning against cutting government spending (austerity).""

  ""explanation"": ""Normally, after a general election the new government presents a budget that follows a predictable routine: they announce any tough decisions early so that by the time voters see the budget, most of the negative news is already out of the way. However, things are different now. Because the current government does not have a strong majority, there is a risk that another election might be called sooner rather than later. This uncertainty means that the government cannot simply raise taxes and expect the public to be patient. In June, many people expressed a desire for more public spending on housing, health services, trains, and roads. They believe that investing in these areas and taxing wealthy individuals more could provide better services, instead of continuing with budget cuts. The main opposition finance spokesperson feels that the public’s attitude changed during 2016 as they grew tired of cuts and looked for an alternative approach.""

  ""summary"": ""Typically, the first budget after an election is straightforward: the finance minister introduces unpopular measures early on, so the economy is in good shape and there's money available closer to the next election. Governments usually stick to this strategy, and it's risky when they don't. However, current times aren't typical. The finance minister can't just raise taxes and expect people to forget about it, because this is a weak government that might fall. Similar to a previous situation, the minister needs to be ready for a possible early election. One reason for this is that many people voted recently wanting improvements like more housing and healthcare funding, which the opposition party promised by borrowing and taxing wealthy individuals. The opposition believes public opinion shifted against government spending cuts during the previous year, both because people got tired of them and because the opposition offered a different plan.""

 St Andrew’s Day, which falls at the end of this month, is celebrated as the feast day of Scotland’s patron saint and a last hurrah before we disappear under an avalanche of mince pies and mulled wine. And if there’s one thing the Scots are good at, apart from politics, economics, terriers and whisky, it’s an honest broth. According to the Victorian journalist and author Christian Isobel Johnstone, who published her The Cook and Housewife’s Manual under the pseudonym Margaret Dods: “The French take the lead of all European people in soups and broths … the Scotch rank second, the Welsh next, and … the English, as a nation, are at the very bottom of the scale.” As an Edinburgh native, she may have been biased, but when one considers the likes of cullen skink, Scotch broth and our subject here, cock-a-leekie, it’s hard not to concede the point. The last, occasionally known as cockie-leekie, is often dated to the end of the 16th century, when the Lincolnshire-born traveller Fynes Moryson records having been served “pullet with some prunes in the broth” at a knight’s house in Scotland, although, given the widespread medieval tradition of meat and fruit pottages, it seems likely that similar dishes were once found throughout northern Europe – even (horror!) south of the border. Happily for us, however, this particular version remained popular in Scotland, and feels a pleasingly simple and wholesome celebratory dish to prepare the stomach for the month to come. The chicken As ever, many recipes call for what the redoubtable Maw Broon calls “an auld boiling fowl” (thanks to Twitter friend of the column Jon Dryden Taylor for supplying the recipe), which is, as we have seen previously, an appropriately tough thing to get hold of in 21st-century Britain. Catherine Brown reckons that “attempting a modern cock-a-leekie with an immature battery chicken is akin to attempting cassoulet without confit”, and, in the absence of decent chicken recommends using “a more flavourful pheasant or other game bird – cock or hen – which has roamed freely”. Having tried her recipe, I can confirm that pheasant makes a delicious soup, even when enjoyed from a bowl in a warm kitchen, rather than from a Thermos in the middle of a damp autumnal copse, but one with a distinct gamey character. Feel free to use pheasant here, if that’s what you have, but chicken, to some extent the older the better, remains the classic choice.

Cock-a-leekie soup, dating back to at least the 16th century, traditionally combines chicken with leeks and sometimes prunes.

 While indulging in booze can inspire cheerful merrymaking in some, for others it can lead to a tearful journey to the bottom of the glass. Now researchers say the emotions people feel when drinking could be linked to their tipple of choice. An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness – but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness – while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. “From a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease – but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,” said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed – an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%.

An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness – but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness – while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. “From a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease – but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,” said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed – an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%.

Okay, here's a simpler explanation:

This news article is about a study that looked at how different alcoholic drinks affect people's emotions. Researchers from around the world surveyed nearly 30,000 people between 18 and 34 about their drinking habits and the emotions they associate with different types of alcohol.

The study found that people often link spirits (like vodka or gin) with feeling energetic, confident, and even sexy. However, spirits were also associated with negative emotions like anger and tearfulness. Red wine, on the other hand, was most often linked to relaxation but also tiredness. Beer was also commonly linked to relaxation.

The researchers hope this study will encourage people to think about the emotional effects of alcohol, not just the physical health risks. Mark Bellis mentioned it's an important ""thing"" to consider, because ""freedom"" to choose drinks can impact your well-being. The researchers aren't pointing fingers, but they want to make sure we don't treat the matter like it's one ""chapter"" in a book and then forget it. If there is a ""suspect"" here, it's perhaps the lack of awareness about how alcohol can mess with emotions. This isn't about anyone getting to ""fly"" away from personal responsibility but choosing wisely what you drink.

 When I took on the main role of caring for my dad, I recognised I had become part of the “sandwich generation” but I didn’t imagine that stage in my life would lead to a new career. A GP practice manager for much of my early working life, I had taken a step back to raise my daughter. In 2003, Dad’s health deteriorated, with heart problems and Parkinson’s disease. My siblings helped and visited him when they could but I lived the closest and had more time, so it made sense for me to help out the most. I’d always thought of care as helping people who need to be taken to the toilet or helped into bed each evening. What I was doing was sitting and talking, going to the supermarket or helping with housework. What I didn’t see at that time was the truth in front of me, that I had actually been delivering relationship-led care and companionship. I feel privileged to have spent that time caring for Dad, and in many ways I got to know more about him over those five years than I might otherwise have done. It came completely naturally to me, but in my mind being a care worker was something very different, so after Dad passed away and I felt ready to get back to work, I discounted it. I had a strong CV after my time in the NHS and felt ready for a new role.

This text is making fun of a movie called ""Best Friend from Heaven"" about a talking dog. The writer is saying that movies about talking animals usually suck and are stupid, mentioning several terrible examples. Despite this, filmmakers keep making these films. The writer is going to analyze the movie's trailer scene by scene, starting with a dog named Gabe whose owner is getting married. The writer sarcastically implies something bad will happen to the dog. These talking animal movies offer no protection from bad filmmaking - they're like building a house on sand instead of solid ground. The writer seems amused that such movies keep getting made, even though viewers would rather stay upstairs than watch them.

Here's my second response:

This news article is criticizing movies about talking animals. The writer thinks these movies suck and are stupid, wondering why filmmakers keep making them when examples like ""Andy the Talking Hedgehog"" were so bad. Now there's a new one called ""Best Friend from Heaven"" that seems especially ridiculous. The writer is going to walk us through the trailer, starting with a dog named Gabe whose owner is getting married. The sarcastic tone suggests something bad happens to the dog. These types of films offer viewers no protection from disappointment - they're built on the sand of a weak premise rather than good storytelling. The writer is implying we'd be better off staying upstairs than watching such films.","This text is humorously pointing out that, even though you’d think movies with talking animals would be done—especially after previous ones that were pretty stupid and kind of sucked—the genre isn’t dead after all.

The author is surprised that movies about talking animals are still being made. They think these movies usually **suck**, mentioning some bad examples. Despite the terrible track record, a new film called ""Best Friend from Heaven"" is coming out, and the author finds it particularly baffling. The trailer begins with a cute dog named Gabe and his owner who is about to get married, making it seem like nothing could go wrong.

The writer can't believe people keep making movies where animals talk. They list examples of films they think are awful and wonders why producers haven't learned their lesson. A new movie, ""Best Friend from Heaven,"" is coming out, and the writer is especially confused by it. The trailer opens with a sweet dog, Gabe, and his owner getting married, creating a sense of impending doom because, clearly, something will inevitably go wrong. It's kind of **stupid** to believe a good marriage will last without effort, and the author thinks the film will likely **suck** like the rest.

 In 2005, before Hurricane Katrina, or the subprime mortgage crisis, or the succession of the first black president by a reality TV star braggart, Jeffrey Eugenides wrote: “One’s country was like oneself, the more you learned about it, the more there was to be ashamed about.” That sentence constitutes the dark heart of a sly yet pathos-packed tale called “Great Experiment” in Fresh Complaint, his recently published first collection of short stories. Twelve years on, surely American national shame is greater than any personal shame? “Oh it’s gotta be equal,” Eugenides sighs. “We all have a slave history past,” and then he laughs sadly. “I think that kind of inventory is endless in both directions – personally and nationally. Right now, perhaps it’s easier to pay attention to the national side of things, but they kind of go hand in hand, don’t they? There are going to be personal blots that plague you as you try to figure out how to negotiate and navigate current events and meet your fellow citizen on the street. A nation is just a bunch of people, so all the problems that happen in the nation are personal, on some level.” He’s speaking in a library in a new building on the campus of Princeton University, where Eugenides, who is now 57, has taught for a decade. The building is not quite finished: with a proper sign yet to come, someone has scrawled “unisex” on a sheet of paper and taped it to the toilet door – a reminder of how much campus life, if not US life at large, has changed in the last 10 years. When Eugenides was on tour for his novel Middlesex, which won the Pulitzer prize in 2003 and remains the most beloved by his readers, he often had to explain what “intersex” meant.

When asked if national shame is greater than personal shame in America today, Eugenides suggests they're equal and connected. He explains the tension between personal and national identity, saying that a nation is just a collection of people, so national problems are ultimately personal too. The interview takes place at Princeton University, where Eugenides has been teaching for ten years, and mentions how the campus environment reflects changing social awareness, such as with unisex bathrooms. The article also notes that Middlesex, Eugenides' most popular novel, dealt with intersex issues before they were widely understood, showing his work often addresses complex health and identity topics that welcome deeper conversations about human experience.

* The article provides context about Eugenides' career and perspective during a challenging time in American history. It references events like Hurricane Katrina and the transition from Obama to Trump to illustrate the growing national shame that Eugenides had anticipated in his writing. There's an underlying tension between personal responsibility and collective guilt that Eugenides explores in his work, particularly in his short story collection ""Fresh Complaint."" The interviewer seems to note the irony that Eugenides' girlfriend character in ""Great Experiment"" expressed shame about America years before the current political climate made such feelings more common.

When the Dursleys try to keep their nephew from his magical destiny by fleeing on a stormy sea, the journey is described thus: “Icy spindrift and rain creepit doon their craigies and a cranreuch wund whuppit their faces.” Some will recognise that word “cranreuch” – cold – from the Burns poem To a Mouse.

Thousands of Zimbabweans turned up outside parliament to urge on MPs, chanting, dancing and waving placards in Africa Unity square. “Mugabe: today is the first day of the rest of your life,” read one. “MPs: You are our salvation,” said another. “We want the guy to go home and rest. We will be very angry if he does not get impeached. Mugabe cannot be part of any solution here,” said Earl Ndawana, a 37 year old graphic designer who had taken a day off from work to attend the rally.” He said that even at 75, Mnangagwa would be a welcome change from 93 year-old Mugabe. “He is young and energetic, at least compared to what we had.” The ruling Zanu-PF party, which at the weekend voted to make Mnangagwa its leader and demote Mugabe to a rank-and-file member, introduced the motion to impeach and the opposition seconded it.

This text is from a letter to the Guardian newspaper. The writer, David Harrison from Brighton, is sharing his memories of railways from the 1950s and 1960s when he was a trainspotter (someone who watches and records train numbers as a hobby).

He's wondering about railway signals - the systems that tell trains when to stop or go. He remembers that in his youth, these signals were mechanical (called ""semaphore"" signals) and were operated by people pulling wires from signal boxes. He doesn't recall these older systems failing very often.

In contrast, he notes that modern railway signals seem to fail frequently, causing daily disruptions to train services. He's asking readers whether the newer technology is actually less reliable than the old system, or if his memory of the past is just viewing things through rose-colored glasses.

The text ends with the newspaper inviting readers to respond to this question or submit their own questions.

The writer recalls that when he was younger, train signals worked with mechanical parts and human operators, and he never experienced problems from these systems. Today, however, modern train signals often fail and cause delays. He is wondering whether the new technology is causing too many issues or if his own memory might be mistaken. Any other questions?","<<Old vs. New Railway Signals>>

A person named David Harrison from Brighton remembers being a trainspotter in the 1950s and 1960s. Back then, train signals were mostly the old-fashioned type controlled by people. He doesn't recall train delays being caused by ""signal failure"" very often. Now, it seems like signal problems cause delays all the time. He's wondering if the newer, more modern technology is actually worse than the old system, or if he's just misremembering how things were.

 As we slide into December, garden centres and supermarkets everywhere are cramming their shelves with Christmas houseplants. Yet from poinsettias to potted Christmas trees, many of these festive favourites can be extremely hard to keep alive in the conditions of the average living room for just a few weeks, let alone year to year. There is, however, a really old-school, and often overlooked, seasonal houseplant that is made from much tougher stuff: the beautiful and exotic Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera truncata and S x buckleyi). These two species (which look so similar that they share a common name) hail from the cool mountains of southeastern Brazil, where they are pollinated by hummingbirds. Unusually for a cactus, they aren’t a desert plant, but have adapted to grow on the boughs of tall rainforest trees, festooning their branches with weeping foliage and dazzling flowers. This relatively cool-weather habitat is surprisingly similar to the conditions of our British living rooms, making them perfectly adapted to thrive in hanging baskets or trail over windowsills everywhere. But what does a cactus have to do with Christmas? Not a great deal, really. In fact, in their native habitat their winter-flowering period doesn’t even coincide with Christmas. However, fortunately for gardeners like me, their habit of bursting into the most spectacular of floral displays from November to January occurs just when I need it most.

Answer with one of the following options: ('My answer is yes.', 'My answer is no.', 'My answer is maybe.')",simplify,"This text is about Christmas houseplants, focusing on the Christmas cactus. It explains that many typical holiday plants like poinsettias are difficult to keep alive in homes, but the Christmas cactus is much hardier. Native to Brazilian mountains, these cacti naturally grow on tree branches in rainforests (not deserts). Their natural habitat happens to be similar to British living rooms, making them well-suited as houseplants. They're called ""Christmas"" cacti because they bloom between November and January in the northern hemisphere, coinciding with the holiday season, though this timing doesn't match their natural flowering period in Brazil.

However, I notice you've asked me to select from specific options, which doesn't seem to match the explanation task. Since there's no yes/no/maybe question being posed in your request, I cannot appropriately select from those options.","Here’s a simpler explanation of the article:

The piece starts by noting that while many Christmas plants are sold in December, most (like poinsettias) can be hard to keep alive indoors for very long. In contrast, it introduces the Christmas cactus—a plant originally from the cooler mountain regions of Brazil that grows in the rainforest on other trees. Unlike most cacti, it’s adapted to cooler and more frequent indoor conditions, so it thrives in British homes. Although its name links it to Christmas, in its natural habitat it doesn't really flower at Christmas; the bloom just happens to occur during winter, which makes it a favoured choice for gardeners during the season.

My answer is maybe.","My answer is yes.

 Boris Johnson and Michael Gove promised Brexit would release an extra £350m a week for the NHS. Now they’ve given the green light to Theresa May to double her offer to settle our obligations to the EU, to a rumoured £40bn. Meanwhile, tomorrow’s budget is likely to confirm that the health service is being starved of funds. But that’s not the end of the story. When the final Brexit bill comes in, it is likely to reach about £80bn – double the prime minister’s latest offer. Not that the government will come clean on this, as it is trying to head off a backlash by Tory backbenchers unhappy that even the £40bn agreed at yesterday’s Brexit cabinet subcommittee is too much. If they realised how much we are going to end up paying, they really would go “bananas” as one MP put it. The government is hoping to defuse opposition from within its own ranks by suggesting the money will come with strings attached: it will be conditional on the EU agreeing a good trade deal or, more realistically, at least agreeing to talk about a future trade deal. May’s new offer could be enough to break the deadlock in the talks at next month’s crucial summit – provided she doesn’t say it’s a “final offer” or add unrealistic conditions to it. After all, the other EU countries have said they will be prepared to move on to talking about our future relationship once “sufficient progress” has been made on the three key divorce issues: money, citizens’ rights and Ireland.

They're trying to soften the blow by saying this payment will only happen if the EU agrees to good trade terms.

Essentially, while earlier promises suggested a big benefit for public health funding, the reality might be very different as the cost of Brexit is increasing, and eventually, when the final bill is calculated, it could be around £80 billion. Some members of the Conservative party are already upset about even the lower offer, worried about the huge financial commitment. The government is trying to make the situation seem more acceptable, suggesting that these payments might come with conditions like achieving a good trade deal with the EU. This routine negotiation isn’t entirely straightforward; it’s a soft approach aimed at mitigating internal disputes and external critiques.

Is there anything else I can help with?","coach. This news piece from The Guardian is essentially highlighting a broken promise related to Brexit and its impact on the UK's National Health Service (NHS). Before Brexit, key figures like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove claimed leaving the EU would free up £350 million per week for the NHS. However, the reality is far from this. The government, now led by Theresa May, is considering significantly increasing the amount of money it offers the EU to settle the UK's financial obligations after Brexit, possibly up to £40 billion. This is happening while the NHS is facing funding shortages, which are expected to be confirmed in the upcoming budget. The overall cost of Brexit could eventually reach £80 billion.

The government is being secretive about the true cost to avoid angering members of its own party who already think the £40 billion offer is too much. They hope to lessen the opposition by saying the payments will only be made if the EU agrees to a favorable trade deal. May's increased offer could potentially get Brexit negotiations moving again, but only if she avoids calling it a ""final offer"" or adding unreasonable conditions. EU countries have indicated they'll discuss future trade once enough progress is made on key divorce issues like money, citizens' rights, and the Irish border. The whole situation feels like a confusing mess, a real black **box** of financial dealings. It's a stark contrast to the promises made before the Brexit vote, a real **day** of reckoning. This whole Brexit process seems to have affected the **gene** pool in parliament with infighting and squabbling. It's disrupted the normal **routine** and is proving to be a **soft** blow to the UK's economy and especially the NHS. Is there anything else I can help with?
